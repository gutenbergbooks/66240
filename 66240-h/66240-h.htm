</div>

<p class='c011'>In a speech delivered at Copenhagen in 1898, Ibsen
said: “It is now thirty-four years since I journeyed
southward by way of Germany and Austria, and passed
through the Alps on May 9. Over the mountains the
clouds hung like a great dark curtain. We plunged in
under it, steamed through the tunnel, and suddenly
found ourselves at Miramare, where the beauty of the
South, a strange luminosity, shining like white marble,
suddenly revealed itself to me, and left its mark on
my whole subsequent production, even though it may
not all have taken the form of beauty.” Whatever
else may have had its origin in this memorable moment
of revelation, <cite>Emperor and Galilean</cite> certainly sprang
from it. The poet felt an irresistible impulse to let
his imagination loose in the Mediterranean world of
sunshine and marble that had suddenly burst upon
him. Antiquity sprang to life before his mental
vision, and he felt that he must capture and perpetuate
the shining pageant in the medium of his art. We
see throughout the play how constantly the element
of external picturesqueness was present to his mind.
Though it has only once or twice found its way to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>stage,<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c012'><sup>[1]</sup></a> it is nevertheless—for good and for ill—a great
piece of scene-painting.</p>

<p class='c001'>It did not take him long to decide upon the central
figure for his picture. What moved him, as it must
move every one who brings to Rome the smallest
scintilla of imagination, was the spectacle of a superb
civilisation, a polity of giant strength and radiant
beauty, obliterated, save for a few pathetic fragments,
and overlaid by forms of life in many ways so retrograde
and inferior. The Rome of the sixties, even
more than the Rome of to-day, was a standing monument
to the triumph of mediævalism over antiquity.
The poet who would give dramatic utterance to the
emotions engendered by this spectacle must almost
inevitably pitch upon the decisive moment in the
transition—and Ibsen found that moment in the
reaction of Julian. He attributed to it more “world-historic”
import than the sober historian is disposed
to allow it. Gaetano Negri<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c012'><sup>[2]</sup></a> shows very clearly (what,
indeed, is plain enough in Gibbon) that Julian’s action
had not the critical importance which Ibsen assigns to
it. His brief reign produced, as nearly as possible,
no effect at all upon the evolution of Christianity.
None the less is it true that Julian made a spiritual
struggle of what had been, to his predecessors, a mere
question of politics, one might almost say of police.
Never until his day did the opposing forces confront
each other in full consciousness of what was at stake;
and never after his day had they even the semblance
of equality requisite to give the struggle dramatic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>interest. As a dramatist, then—whatever the historian
may say—Ibsen chose his protagonist with unerring
instinct. Julian was the last, and not the least, of the
heroes of antiquity.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ibsen had been in Rome only two or three months
when he wrote to Björnson (September 16, 1864):
“I am busied with a long poem, and have in preparation
a tragedy, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Julianus Apostata</cite></span>, a piece of work
which I set about with intense gusto, and in which I
believe I shall succeed. I hope to have both finished
next spring, or, at any rate, in the course of the
summer.” As regards <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Julianus Apostata</cite></span>, this hope
was very far astray, for nine years elapsed before
the play was finished.<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c012'><sup>[3]</sup></a> Not till May 4, 1866, is the
project again mentioned, when Ibsen writes to his
friend, Michael Birkeland, that, though the Danish
poet, Hauch, has in the meantime produced a play
on the same theme, he does not intend to abandon it.
On May 21, 1866, he writes to his publisher, Hegel,
that, now that <cite>Brand</cite> is out of hand, he is still undecided
what subject to tackle next. “I feel more and
more disposed,” he says, “to set to work in earnest
at <cite>Kejser Julian</cite>, which I have had in mind for two
years.” He feels sure that Hauch’s conception of the
subject must be entirely different from his; and he
does not intend to read Hauch’s play. On July
22, 1866, he writes from Frascati to Paul Botten-Hansen
that he is “wrestling with a subject and knows
that he will soon get the upper hand of the brute.”
His German editors take this to refer to <cite>Emperor and
Galilean</cite>, and they are probably right; but it is not
quite certain. The work he actually produced was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span><cite>Peer Gynt</cite>; and we know that he had a third subject
in mind at the time. We hear no more of Julian
until October 28, 1870, when, in his autobiographic
letter to Peter Hansen, he writes from Dresden:
“... Here I live in a tediously well-ordered community.
What will become of me when at last I
actually reach home! I must seek salvation in remoteness
of subject, and think of attacking <span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><cite>Kejser
Julian</cite></span>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>This was, in fact, to be his next work; but two
years and a half were still to pass before he finally
“got the upper hand of the brute.” On January
18, 1871, he writes to Hegel: “Your supposition
that <cite>Julian</cite> is so far advanced that it may go to the
printers next month arises from a misunderstanding.
The first part is finished; I am working at the second
part; but the third part is not even begun. This
third part will, however, go comparatively quickly,
and I confidently hope to place the whole in your
hands by the month of June.” This is the first mention
we have of the division into three parts, which he
ultimately abandoned. If Hegel looked for the
manuscript in June, he looked in vain. On July 12
Ibsen wrote to him: “Now for the reason of my long
silence: I am hard at work on <cite>Kejser Julian</cite>. This
book will be my chief work, and it is engrossing all
my thoughts and all my time. That positive view of
the world which the critics have so long been demanding
of me, they will find here.” Then he asks Hegel
to procure for him three articles on <cite>Julian</cite> by Pastor
Listov, which had appeared in the Danish paper,
<span lang="da" xml:lang="da"><cite>Fædrelandet</cite></span>, and inquires whether there is in Danish
any other statement of the <em>facts</em> of Julian’s career. “I
have Neander’s German works on the subject; also
D. Strauss’s; but the latter’s book contains nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>but argumentative figments,<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c012'><sup>[4]</sup></a> and that sort of thing
I can do myself. It is facts that I require.” His
demand for more facts, even at this stage of the proceedings,
shows that his work must still have been in
a pretty fluid state.</p>

<p class='c001'>Two months later (September 24, 1871) Ibsen wrote
to Brandes, who had apparently been urging him to
“hang out a banner” or nail his colours to the
mast: “While I have been busied upon <cite>Julian</cite>, I have
become, in a way, a fatalist; and yet this play will be
a sort of a banner. Do not be afraid, however, of any
tendency-nonsense: I look at the characters, at the
conflicting designs, at <em>history</em>, and do not concern
myself with the ‘moral’ of it all. Of course, you will
not confound the moral of history with its philosophy;
for that must inevitably shine forth as the final verdict
on the conflicting and conquering forces.” On December
27 (still from Dresden) he writes to Hegel:
“My new work goes steadily forward. The first part,
<cite>Julian and the Philosophers</cite>, in three acts, is already
copied out.... I am busily at work upon the second
part, which will go quicker and be considerably shorter;
the third part, on the other hand, will be somewhat
longer.” To the same correspondent, on April 24, 1872,
he reports the second part almost finished. “The
third and last part,” he says, “will be mere child’s
play. The spring has now come, and the warm season
is my best time for working.” To Brandes, on May 31,
he writes, “I go on wrestling with <cite>Julian</cite>”; and on
July 23 (from Berchtesgaden) “That monster Julian
has still such a grip of me that I cannot shake him
off.” On August 8 he announces to Hegel that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>has “completed the second part of the trilogy.
The first part, <cite>Julian and the Philosophers</cite>, a play in
three acts, will make about a hundred printed pages.
The second part, <cite>Julian’s Apostasy</cite>, a play in three acts,
of which I am now making a fair copy, will be of
about equal length. The third play, <cite>Julian on the
Imperial Throne</cite>, will run to five acts, and my preparations
for it are so far advanced that I shall get it out
of hand very much quicker than the others. What I
have done forms a whole in itself, and could quite
well be published separately; but for the sake of the
complete impression I think it most advisable that all
three plays should appear together.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Two months later (October 14) the poet is back in
Dresden, and writes as follows to a new and much-valued
friend, Mr Edmund Gosse: “I am working
daily at <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Julianus Apostata</cite></span>, and ... hope that it may
meet with your approval. I am putting into this book
a part of my own spiritual life; what I depict, I have,
under other forms, myself gone through, and the
historic theme I have chosen has also a much closer
relation to the movements of our own time than one
might at first suppose. I believe such a relation to be
indispensable to every modern treatment of so remote
a subject, if it is, as a poem, to arouse interest.” In
a somewhat later letter to Mr. Gosse he says: “I have
kept strictly to history.... And yet I have put much
self-anatomy into this book.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In February 1873 the play was finished. On the
4th of that month Ibsen writes to his old friend
Ludvig Daae that he is on the point of beginning his
fair copy of what he can confidently say will be his
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hauptwerk</span>,” and wants some guidance as to the
proper way of spelling Greek names. Oddly enough,
he is still in search of facts, and asks for information
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>as to the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><cite>Vita Maximi</cite></span> of Eunapius, which has not been
accessible to him. Two days later (February 6) he
writes to Hegel: “I have the great pleasure of
being able to inform you that my long work is finished—and
more to my satisfaction than any of my earlier
works. The book is entitled <cite>Emperor and Galilean, a
World-Drama in Two Parts</cite>. It contains: Part First,
<cite>Caesar’s Apostasy</cite>; play in five acts (170 pp.); Part
Second, <cite>The Emperor Julian</cite>, play in five acts (252 pp.)....
Owing to the growth of the idea during the process
of composition, I shall have to make another fair
copy of the first play. But it will not become longer
in the process; on the contrary, I hope to reduce it
by about twenty pages.... This play has been to me
a labour of Hercules—not the actual <a id='corrxiii.14'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='composition'>composition:</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_xiii.14'><ins class='correction' title='composition'>composition:</ins></a></span>
that has been easy—but the effort it has cost me to
live myself into a fresh and visual realisation of so
remote and so unfamiliar an age.” On February 23,
he writes to Ludvig Daae, discussing further the
orthography of the Greek names, and adding: “My
play deals with a struggle between two irreconcileable
powers in the life of the world—a struggle which will
always repeat itself. Because of this universality, I
call the book ‘a world-historic drama.’ For the rest,
there is in the character of Julian, as in most that
I have written during my riper years, more of my
own spiritual experience than I care to acknowledge
to the public. But it is at the same time an entirely
realistic piece of work. The figures stood solidly before
my eyes in the light of their time—and I hope
they will so stand before the readers’ eyes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The book was not published until the autumn
(October 16, 1873). On September 8, Ibsen wrote to
Brandes that he was daily expecting its appearance.
“I hear from Norway,” he went on, “that Björnson,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>though he cannot know anything about the book, has
declared it to be ‘Atheism,’ adding that it was inevitable
it should come to that with me. What the
book is or is not I won’t attempt to decide; I only
know that I have energetically seen a fragment of the
history of humanity, and what I saw I have tried to
reproduce.” On the very day of the book’s appearance,
he again writes to Brandes from Dresden: “The
direction public affairs have taken in these parts
gives this poem an actuality I myself had not foreseen.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A second edition of <cite>Emperor and Galilean</cite> appeared
in December 1873. In the following January Ibsen
writes to Mr. Gosse, who had expressed some regret
at his abandonment of verse: “The illusion I wished
to produce was that of reality. I wished to leave on
the reader’s mind the impression that what he had
read had actually happened. By employing verse I
should have counteracted my own intention.... The
many everyday, insignificant characters, whom I have
intentionally introduced, would have become indistinct
and mixed up with each other had I made them all
speak in rhythmic measure. We no longer live in the
days of Shakespeare.... The style ought to conform
to the degree of ideality imparted to the whole presentment.
My play is no tragedy in the ancient acceptation.
My desire was to depict human beings and
therefore I would not make them speak the language
of the gods.” A year later (January 30, 1875) he
thus answers a criticism by George Brandes: “I cannot
but find an inconsistency between your disapproval
of the doctrine of necessity contained in my book, and
your approval of something very similar in Paul
Heyse’s <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Kinder der Welt</cite></span>. For in my opinion it comes
to much the same thing whether, in writing of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>person’s character, I say ‘It runs in his blood’ or ‘He
is free—under necessity.’”</p>

<p class='c001'>An expression in the same letter throws light on the
idea which may be called the keystone of the arch of
thought erected in this play. “Only entire nations,”
Ibsen writes, “can join in great intellectual movements.
A change of front in our conception of life and of the
world is no parochial matter; and we Scandinavians,
as compared with other European nations, have not
yet got beyond the parish-council standpoint. But
nowhere do you find a parish-council anticipating and
furthering ‘the third empire.’” To the like effect
runs a passage in a speech delivered at Stockholm,
September 24, 1887: “I have sometimes been called
a pessimist: and indeed I am one, inasmuch as I do
not believe in the eternity of human ideals. But I
am also an optimist, inasmuch as I fully and confidently
believe in the ideals’ power of propagation and of
development. Especially and definitely do I believe
that the ideals of our time, as they pass away, are
tending towards that which, in my drama of <cite>Emperor
and Galilean</cite>, I have designated as ‘the third empire.’
Let me therefore drain my glass to the growing, the
coming time.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The latest (so far as I know) of Ibsen’s references
to this play is perhaps the most significant of all. It
occurs in a letter to the Danish-German scholar Julius
Hoffory, written from Munich, February 26, 1888:
“<cite>Emperor and Galilean</cite> is not the first work I wrote in
Germany, but doubtless the first that I wrote under
the influence of German spiritual life. When, in the
autumn of 1868, I came from Italy to Dresden, I
brought with me the plan of <cite>The League of Youth</cite>, and
wrote that play in the following winter. During my
four years’ stay in Rome, I had merely made various
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>historical studies, and taken sundry notes, for <cite>Emperor
and Galilean</cite>; I had not sketched out any definite
plan, much less written any of it. My view of
life was still, at that time, National-Scandinavian,
wherefore I could not master the foreign material.
Then, in Germany, I lived through the great time, the
year of the war, and the development which followed
it. This brought with it for me, at many points, an
impulse of transformation. My conception of world-history
and of human life had hitherto been a national
one. It now widened into a racial conception; and
then I could write <cite>Emperor and Galilean</cite>.”</p>

<p class='c013'>I have now brought together those utterances of
Ibsen’s which relate the external history of the great
double-drama, and give us some insight into the
spiritual influences which inspired and shaped it. We
have seen that, at the time of its completion, he confidently
regarded it as his masterpiece. It is the habit
of many artists always to think their last work their
best; but there is nothing to show that this was one
of Ibsen’s foibles. Moreover, even towards the end
of his life, when the poet was asked by Professor
Schofield, of Harvard, what work he considered
his greatest, he replied, <cite>Emperor and Galilean</cite>. If
this was his deliberate and lasting opinion, we have
here another curious instance of the tendency, so
frequent among authors, to capricious over-valuation
of one or another of their less successful efforts.
Certainly we should be very sorry to miss this splendid
fresco of the decadent Empire from the list of Ibsen’s
works; but neither technically nor intellectually—unless
I am very much mistaken—can it rank among his
masterpieces.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xvii'>xvii</span>Of all historical plays it is perhaps the most strictly
historical. Apart from some unimportant chronological
rearrangements, the main lines of Julian’s
career are reproduced with extraordinary fidelity. The
individual occurrences of the first play are for the
most part invented, and the dialogue freely composed;
but the second play is a mere mosaic of historical
or legendary incidents, while a large part of the
dialogue is taken, almost word for word, either from
Julian’s own writings, or from other historical or quasi-historical
documents. I will try to distinguish briefly
between the elements of history and fiction in the
first play: in the second there is practically no fiction
save the fictions of Gregory and the ecclesiastical
historians.</p>

<p class='c001'>The details of the first act have no historical foundation.
Gallus was not appointed Caesar on any such
occasion as Ibsen describes; and there seems to be no
hint of any intrigue between him and Helena. The
character of Agathon is fictitious, though all that is related
of Julian’s life in Cappadocia is historical. The
meeting with Libanius is an invention; and it was to
Nicomedia, not to Pergamus, that Julian was sent
shortly after the elevation of his brother to the second
place in the Empire.</p>

<p class='c001'>The chronological order of the events on which the
second and third acts are founded is reversed by Ibsen.
Julian fell under the influence of Maximus before ever
he went to Athens. Eunapius relates his saying, “I
go where torches light themselves, and where statues
smile,” or words to that effect; but they were spoken
at Pergamus to Chrysantius, a Neo-Platonist, who,
while deprecating the thaumaturgic methods of Maximus,
averred that he himself had witnessed this marvel.
For the details of the symposium at Ephesus there is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>no foundation, though Gregory and others relate
weird legends of supernatural experiences which
Julian underwent at the instance of Maximus. Not
till after the disgrace and death of Gallus did Julian
proceed to Athens, where he did not study under
Libanius. Indeed, I cannot discover that he ever
personally encountered Libanius before his accession
to the throne. It is true that Gregory and Basil were
his fellow students at Athens; but the tender friendship
which Ibsen represents as existing between them
is certainly imaginary.</p>

<p class='c001'>All the military events at Paris, and the story of
Julian’s victory over Knodomar, are strictly historical.
Helena, however, did not die at Paris, but at Vienne,
after her husband had assumed the purple. Her death
was said to have been indirectly due to a jealous machination
of the Empress Eusebia; but the incident of
the poisoned fruit is quite fictitious, and equally so are
the vague enormities revealed in the dying woman’s
delirium. From the fact that Julian is strangely
silent about his wife, we may conjecture that their
marriage was not a happy one; but this is all the
foundation Ibsen had to build upon.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c012'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xix'>xix</span>For the scene in the Catacombs at Vienne there is
nothing that can fairly be called a historic basis. It
is true that, after assuming the purple, Julian did at
one time endanger his position by shutting himself
away from his soldiery; it is true, or at least it is related,
that Julian “brought from Greece into Gaul the
high priest of the mysteries—the Hierophant, as he
was called [not Maximus]—and did not decide to rebel
until he had, with the greatest secrecy, accomplished
the prescribed sacred rites.” There is also a vague,
and probably mythical, report of his having gone
through some barbarous ceremony of purification, in
order to wipe out the stain of his baptism. On such
slight suggestions did Ibsen build up the elaborate
fabric of his fifth act. The character of Sallust, like
that of Oribases, is historical: but of any approach to
double-dealing on the part of the excellent Sallust
there is no hint. As there is no foundation for the
infidelity of the living Helena, so there is no foundation
for the part played by Helena dead in determining
Julian’s apostasy.</p>

<p class='c001'>While Ibsen invents, however, he does not falsify;
it is when he ceases to invent (paradoxically enough)
that falsification sets in. In all essentials, this first play
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xx'>xx</span>is a representation of the youth of Julian as just as it
is vivid. His character is very truly portrayed—his
intellectual and moral earnestness, his superstition,
his vanity, his bravery, his military genius. The individual
scenes are full of poetic and dramatic inspiration.
There may be some question, indeed, as to
the artistic legitimacy of the employment of the supernatural
in the third act; but of its imaginative power
there can be no doubt. The drama progresses in
an ever-ascending scale of interest, from the idyllic-spectacular
opening, through the philosophic second
act, the mystic third act, the stirring and terrible
fourth act, up to the magnificent poetic melodrama of
the fifth. In a slightly old-fashioned, romantic style,
the play is as impressive to the imagination as it is,
in all essentials, faithful to historic fact.</p>

<p class='c001'>When Julian has ascended the throne, a wholly
different method of treatment sets in. We could almost
guess from internal evidence, what Ibsen’s letters
prove to be the fact—that he underwent a decisive
change of mental attitude during the process of composition.
The original first part, we see (that is to say
the three-act play which was to have been called
<cite>Julian and the Philosophers</cite>), was finished some time
before January 18, 1871, on which date he tells Hegel
that he is already at work on the second part. But
January 18, 1871, was the very day on which, at Versailles,
the King of Prussia was proclaimed German
Emperor; so that the first part must have been written
before the Imperialisation of Germany was even to be
foreseen. While the poet was engaged upon the
second part of the “trilogy” he then designed, he
was doubtless brooding over the great event of
January 18, and gradually realising its nature and
consequences. That change in his mental attitude was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxi'>xxi</span>taking place, which in his letter to Hoffory (p. xvi.)
he described as the transition from a national to a
racial standpoint. While in January he “confidently
hopes” to have the whole play finished in June, July
finds him, to all appearance, no further advanced, and
(very significantly) asking for “facts,” documents of
detail, whereof, in writing the first play, he had felt
no need. At the same time he tells Hegel that the
critics will find in the play that positive view of the
world for which they have long been clamouring—a
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>Weltanschauung</i></span>, we may fairly conjecture, at which he
has arrived during the six months’ interval since his
last letter.</p>

<p class='c001'>What, then, was that “positive view”? It can
have been nothing else than the theory of the “third
empire,” which is to absorb both Paganism and
Christianity, and is to mark, as it were, the maturity
of the race, in contrast to its Pagan childhood and its
Christian adolescence. (Compare the scene between
Julian and Maximus at the end of Part II. Act III.)
The analogy between this theory and the Nietzschean
conception of the “Overman” need not here be emphasised.
It is sufficient to note that Ibsen had
come to conceive world-history as moving, under the
guidance of a Will which works through blinded,
erring, and sacrificed human instruments, towards a
“third empire,” in which the jarring elements of flesh
and spirit shall be reconciled.</p>

<p class='c001'>It may seem like a play on the word “empire” to
connect this concept with the establishment in January
1871 of a political confederation of petty States, compared
with which even Julian’s <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“orbis terrarum”</span> was
a world-empire indeed. But there is ample proof that
in Ibsen’s mind political unification, the formation of
large aggregates inspired by a common idea, figured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxii'>xxii</span>as a preliminary to the coming of the “third empire.”
In no other sense can we read the letters to Hoffory
and Brandes cited above (p. xv.); and I give in a footnote<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c012'><sup>[6]</sup></a>
a reference to other passages of similar tenor.
“But Julian,” it may be said, “represented precisely
the ideal of political cohesion which was revived
in the unification of Germany; why, then, should
Ibsen, in writing the second play, have (so to speak)
turned against his hero?” The reason, I think, was
that Ibsen had come to feel that a loose political
unity could be of little avail without the spiritual
fusion implied in a world-religion; and this fusion
it was Julian’s tragic error to oppose. He was a
political imperialist by inheritance and as a matter
of course; but what he really cared for, the point on
which he bent his will, was the restoration of
polytheism with all its local cults. And here Ibsen
parted company with him. He sympathised to the
full with Julian’s rebellion against certain phases of
Christianity—against book-worship, death-worship,
other-worldliness, hypocrisy, intolerance. He had
himself gone through this phase of feeling. During
his first years in Rome, he had seen the ruins of the
ancient world of light and glory sicklied o’er with the
pale cast of mediaevalism; and he had ardently sympathised
with Julian’s passionate resentment against
the creed which had defamed and defaced the old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiii'>xxiii</span>beauty in the name of a truth that was so radically
corrupted as to be no longer true. In this mood he
had conceived and in great measure executed the
First Part, as we now possess it. But further study
of detail, in the light of that new political conception
which had arisen out of the events of 1870-71, had
shown him that the secret of Julian’s failure lay in
the hopeless inferiority of the religion he championed
to the religion he attacked. That religion, with all its
corruptions, came to seem a necessary stage in the
evolution of humanity; and the poet asked himself,
perhaps, whether he, any more than Julian, had even
now a more practical substitute to offer in its place.
In this sense, I take it, we must read his repeated
assertion that he had put into the play much of his
own “spiritual experience.” In the concept of the
“third empire” he found, I repeat, the keystone to
his arch of thought, to which everything else must be
brought into due relation. He re-wrote (it seems probable)
the scene of the symposium (Part I. Act III.) in
order to emphasise this idea; and it entirely dominated
and conditioned the whole of the second play.</p>

<p class='c001'>But what was the effect of the concept? It was
to make Julian a plaything in the hands of some
power, some implicitly-postulated World-Will, working
slowly, deviously, but relentlessly, towards a far-off,
dimly-divined consummation. Christianity, no doubt,
was also an instrument of this power; but it was an
instrument predestined (for the moment) to honourable
uses, while its opponent was fated to dishonour.
Thus the process of the second part is a gradual sapping
of Julian’s intelligence and power of moral discrimination;
while the World-Will, acting always on the side
of Christianity, becomes indistinguishable from the
mechanical Providence of the vulgar melodramatist.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiv'>xxiv</span>Whatever we may think of the historical or philosophical
value of the theory of the “third empire,”
there can be little doubt that its effect upon the play
has been artistically disastrous. It has led Ibsen to
cog the dice against Julian in a way from which even
a Father of the Church might have shrunk. He has
not only accepted uncritically all the invectives of
Gregory, and the other Christian assailants of “Antichrist,”
but he has given to many historic events a
fictitious twist, and always to Julian’s disadvantage.<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c012'><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c001'>It would need a volume to apply to each incident of
the Second Part the test of critical examination. I
must be content with a rough outline of the distorting
effect of the poet’s preoccupation with his “world-historic”
idea.</p>

<p class='c001'>In the first place, he makes Julian much more of a
persecutor than even his enemies allege him to have
been. Nothing is more certain than that Julian was
sincerely convinced of the inefficacy of violence as a
means of conversion, and keenly alive to the impolicy
of conferring upon his opponents the distinction of
martyrdom. Tried by the standards of his age, he was
a marvellously humane man. Compared with his
uncle, Constantine, his cousin Constantius, his brother
Gallus—to go no further back among wearers of the
purple—he seems like a being of another race. It is
quite true, as his enemies allege, that his clemency
was politic as well as humane; but, whatever its
motives, it was real and consistent. Gregory, while
trying to make him out a monster, explicitly and repeatedly
complains that he denied to Christians the
crown of martyrdom. Saint Jerome speaks of his
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“blanda persecutio”</span>—persecution by methods of mildness.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxv'>xxv</span>The worst that can be alleged against him is a
lack of diligence in punishing popular outrages upon
the Christians (generally of the nature of reprisals)
which occurred here and there under his rule. That
he incited to such riots is nowhere alleged; and it is
difficult to judge whether his failure to repress them
was due to malicious inertia or to actual lack of
power. The policing of the empire cannot have been
an easy matter, and Julian was occupied, during the
whole of his brief reign, in concentrating his forces
for the Persian expedition. It cannot be pretended
that his tolerance rose to the pitch of impartiality.
He favoured Pagans, and he more or less oppressed
Christians; though a considerable part of his alleged
oppression lay in the withdrawal of extravagant privileges
conferred on them by his predecessors. In his
attempt to undo some of the injustices that Christians
had committed during their forty years of predominance—such
as the seizure of temple glebes and so
forth—he was doubtless guilty, on his own account,
of more than one injustice. Wrong breeds wrong,
and, in a time of religious dissolution and reconstruction,
equity is always at the mercy of passion, resentment
and greed. There was even, in some of Julian’s
proceedings, a sort of perfidy and insolence that must
have been peculiarly galling to the Christians. It
would not be altogether unjust to accuse him of having
instituted against the new religion a campaign of
chicanery; but that is something wholly different
from a campaign of blood. The alleged “martyrdoms”
of his reign are few in number,<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c012'><sup>[8]</sup></a> are recounted by late
and prejudiced authorities, are accompanied by all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvi'>xxvi</span>manifestly fabulous details characteristic of such
stories, and are none of them, with the smallest show
of credibility, laid to the account of Julian himself.</p>

<p class='c001'>But what is the impression we receive from Ibsen?
We are given to understand that Julian drifted into a
campaign of sanguinary atrocity, full of horrors as
great as those recorded or imagined of the persecutions
under Decius or Diocletian. It is made to seem, moreover,
that he was personally concerned in some of the
worst of these horrors. We are asked to conceive his
life as being passed with the mingled shrieks and
psalms of his victims ringing in his ears. He is made
to gloat in imagination over their physical agonies.
(“Where are the Galileans now? Some under the executioner’s
hands, others flying through the narrow
streets, ashy pale with terror, their eyes starting from
their heads,” &amp;c. &amp;c.; p. 314). He is haunted in his
last hours by ghastly visions of whole troops of
martyrs. Moreover, his persecutions are made particularly
hateful by the fact that they either fall upon
or threaten his personal friends. The companion of
his childhood, Agathon (a fictitious personage), is
goaded by remorseless cruelty to that madness which
eventually makes him the assassin of Antichrist.
Gregory of Nazianzus is first made (what he never was)
Julian’s most cherished comrade, and is then shown as
doing what he never did—playing a noble and heroic
part in personally defying the tyrant. Mad and monstrous
designs are attributed to Julian, such as that
of searching out (with the aid of tortures) and destroying
all the writings of the Christians. This trait appears
to be suggested by a letter from Julian to the
Prefect of Egypt enjoining him to collect and preserve
all the books which had belonged to George,
Bishop of Alexandria: “He had many of them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvii'>xxvii</span>concerning philosophy and rhetoric, and many of them
that contained the doctrines of the impious Galileans.
I would willingly see the last named all destroyed,
if I did not fear that some good and useful books
might, at the same time, be destroyed by mistake.
Make, therefore, the most minute search concerning
them. In this search the secretary of George may be
of great help to you.... But if he try to deceive
you in this affair, submit him immediately to the torture.”
It is needless to remark upon the difference
between a rhetorical wish that all the Christian books
in a particular library might be destroyed, and an
actual attempt to annihilate all the Christian writings
in the world. Thus not only are the clearest evidences
of Julian’s abstention from violence disregarded, but
all sorts of minor incidents are misrepresented to his
disadvantage.</p>

<p class='c001'>A particularly grave injustice to his character
meets us almost on the threshold of the Second Part.
The execution of the Treasurer, Ursulus, by the
military tribunal which Julian appointed on coming
to the throne, is condemned by all historians and was
regretted by Julian himself. No doubt he was
culpably remiss in not preventing it; but Ibsen,
without the slightest warrant, gives his conduct a
peculiarly odious character in making it appear that
he deliberately sacrificed the old man to his resentment
of a blow administered to his vanity in the matter of
the Eastern Ambassadors. There is nothing whatever
to connect Ursulus with this incident.</p>

<p class='c001'>The failure of Julian’s effort to rebuild the Temple
of Jerusalem is a matter of unquestioned history. It
is impossible now to determine, though it is easy to
conjecture, what natural accidents were magnified by
fanaticism into supernatural intervention. But what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxviii'>xxviii</span>does Ibsen do? He is not even content with the comparatively
rational account of the matter given by
Gregory within a few months of its occurrence. He
adopts Ammian’s later and much exaggerated account;
he makes Jovian, who had nothing to do with the
affair, avouch it with the authority of an eye-witness;
and, to give the miracle a still more purposeful significance,
he represents it as the instrument of the conversion
of Jovian, who was to be Julian’s successor,
and the undoer of his work. Under ordinary circumstances,
this would be a quite admissible re-arrangement
of history, designed to save the introduction of
another character. But the very fact that the poet
is, throughout the play, so obviously sacrificing
dramatic economy and concentration to historic accuracy,
renders this heightening of the alleged miracle
something very like a falsification of evidence. It
arises, of course, from no desire to be unjust to Julian,
for whom Ibsen’s sympathy remains unmistakable,
but from a determination to make him the tragic
victim of a World-Will pitilessly using him as an
instrument to its far-off ends.</p>

<p class='c001'>But this conception of a vague external power
interfering at all sorts of critical moments to baffle
designs of which, for one reason or another, it disapproves,
belongs to the very essence of melodrama.
Therefore the incident of the Temple of Jerusalem
brings with it painful associations of <cite>The Sign of the
Cross</cite>; and still more suggestive of that masterpiece
is the downfall of the Temple of Apollo at Daphne
which brings the second act of the Second Part to a
close. Here the poet deliberately departs from history
for the sake of a theatrical effect. The temple of
Apollo was not destroyed by an earthquake, nor in any
way that even suggested a miracle. It was simply
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxix'>xxix</span>burnt to the ground; and though there was no
evidence to show how the conflagration arose, the
suspicion that it was the work of Christians cannot be
regarded as wholly unreasonable.</p>

<p class='c001'>An incident of which Ibsen quite uncritically accepts
the accounts of Julian’s enemies is his edict imposing
what we should now call a test on the teachers in
public (municipal) schools. This was probably an impolitic
act; but an act of frantic tyranny it certainly
was not. Homer and Hesiod were in Julian’s eyes
sacred books. They were the Scriptures of his religion;
and he decreed that they should not be expounded
to children, at the public expense, by
“atheists” who (unless they were hypocrites as well)
were bound to cast ridicule and contempt on them as
religious documents. It is not as though Christians
of that age could possibly have been expected to treat
the Olympian divinities with the decent reverence with
which even an agnostic teacher of to-day will speak of
the Gospel story. Such tolerance was foreign to the
whole spirit of fourth-century Christianity. It was
nothing if not intolerant; and the teacher would have
been no good Christian who did not make his lessons
the vehicle of proselytism. There is something a little
paradoxical in the idea that tolerance should go the
length of endowing the propagation of intolerance.
It is quite false to represent Julian’s measure as an
attempt to deprive Christians of all instruction, and
hurl them back into illiterate barbarism. He explicitly
states that Christian children are as welcome as ever
to attend the schools.</p>

<p class='c001'>As the drama draws to a close, Ibsen shows his hero
at every step more pitifully hoodwinked and led astray
by the remorseless World-Will. He regains, towards
the end, a certain tragic dignity, but it is at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxx'>xxx</span>expense of his sanity. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“Quos deus vult perdere prius
dementat.”</span> Now, there is no real evidence for the
frenzied megalomania, the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“Cäsarenwahn,”</span> which the
poet attributes to Julian. It is not even certain that
his conduct of the Persian expedition was so rash and
desperate as it is represented to be. Gibbon (no blind
partisan of Julian’s) has shown that there is a case to be
made even for the burning of the fleet. The mistake,
perhaps, lay, not so much in burning it, as in having
it there at all. Even as events fell out, the result of
the expedition was by no means the greatest disaster
that ever befell the Roman arms. The commonplace,
self-indulgent Jovian brought the army off, ignominiously
indeed, but in tolerable preservation. Had
Julian lived, who knows but that the burning of
the ships might now have ranked as one of the
most brilliant audacities recorded in the annals of
warfare?</p>

<p class='c001'>It would be too much, perhaps, to expect any poet
to resist the introduction of the wholly unhistoric
“I am hammering the Emperor’s coffin,” and “Thou
hast conquered, Galilean!” They certainly fell in too
aptly with Ibsen’s scheme for him to think of weighing
their evidences. But one significant instance may
be noted of the way in which he twists things to the
detriment either of Julian’s character or of his sanity.
In the second scene of the fifth act, he makes Julian
contemplate suicide by drowning, in the hope that, if
his body disappeared, the belief would spread abroad
that he had been miraculously snatched up into the
communion of the gods. Now Gregory, it is true,
mentions the design of suicide; but he mentions it as
an incident of Julian’s delirium <em>after</em> his wound.
Gregory’s virulence of hatred makes him at best a
suspected witness; but even he did not hold Julian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxi'>xxxi</span>capable of so mad a fantasy before his intellect had
been overthrown by physical suffering and fever.</p>

<p class='c001'>Thus from step to step, throughout the Second
Part, does Ibsen disparage and degrade his hero. It
is not for me to discuss the value of the conception of
the “third empire” to which poor Julian was sacrificed.
But one thing we may say with confidence—namely,
that the postulated World-Will does not work
by such extremely melodramatic methods as those
which Ibsen attributes to it. So far as its incidents
are concerned, the Second Part might have been designed
by a superstitious hagiologist, or a melodramatist
desirous of currying favour with the clergy.
Nay, it might almost seem as though the spirit of
Gregory of Nazianzus—himself a dramatist after a
fashion—had entered into Ibsen during the composition
of the play. Certainly, if the World-Will decreed
that Julian should be sacrificed in the cause of the
larger Imperialism, it made of Ibsen, too, its instrument
for completing the immolation.</p>

<p class='c013'>In translating <span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><cite>Kejser og Galilæer</cite></span> I was enabled (by
arrangement) to avail myself of occasional aid from
Miss Catherine Ray’s version of the play, published
in 1876. To Miss Ray belongs the credit of having
been the first English translator of Ibsen, as Mr.
Gosse was his first expositor. The text of my earlier
rendering has been very carefully revised for the present
edition.</p>

<p class='c001'>One difficulty has encountered me at every turn.
The Norwegians use only one word—<span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><i>Riget</i></span> (German
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><i>das Reich</i></span>)—to cover the two ideas represented in
English by “empire” and “kingdom.” In most cases
“empire” is clearly the proper rendering, since it
would be absurd to speak in English of the Roman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxii'>xxxii</span>or the Byzantine Kingdom. But it would be no less
impossible to say, in the Lord’s Prayer, “Thine is
the empire and the power and the glory.” In the
scene with Maximus in Ephesus, and in several other
passages, I have used the word “empire” where
“kingdom,” in its Biblical sense, would have been
preferable, were it not necessary to keep the analogy
or contrast between the temporal and the spiritual
“empire” clearly before the reader’s mind. But at
the end of the fifth act of <cite>Caesar’s Apostasy</cite>, where
the Lord’s Prayer is interwoven with the dialogue,
I have been forced to fall back on “kingdom.” The
reader, then, will please remember that these two
words stand for one word—<span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><i>Riget</i></span>—in the original.</p>

<p class='c001'>The verse from Homer quoted by Julian in the
third act of the second play occurs in the twentieth
book of the <cite>Odyssey</cite> (line 18). Ibsen prints the
sentence which follows it as a second hexameter line;
but either he or one of his authorities has apparently
misread the passage in the treatise, <cite>Against the
Cynic Heraclius</cite>, on which this scene is founded. No
such line occurs in Homer; and in the attack on
Heraclius, the phrase about the mad dog appears
as part of the author’s text, not as a quotation. I
have ventured, therefore, to “render unto Caesar the
things that are Caesar’s,” and print the phrase as
Julian’s own.</p>

<p class='c001'><a href='#r5'>5</a>. I may, perhaps, be excused for quoting at this point an
extract from a review of Negri’s <cite>Julian the Apostate</cite>, in which
I tried to summarise the reasons of Julian’s hatred of Christianity:
“Firstly, he was unmoved by the merits of the
Christian ethic, even where it coincided with his own, because
he saw it so flagrantly ignored by the corrupt Christianity of
his day. A puritan in the purple, he was morally too Christian
to be a Christian of the fourth-century Church. Secondly, he
hated the pessimism of Christianity—that very throwing-forward
of its hopes to the life beyond the grave which so eminently
fitted it to a period of social catastrophe and dissolution. He
found its heaven and hell vulgar and contemptible, and regarded
the average Christian as a sort of spiritual brandy-tippler, who
rejected, for a crude stimulant and anodyne, the delicate
lemonade of Neo-Platonic polytheism. Thirdly, he resented
what he called the ‘atheism’ of Christianity, its elimination
of the divine from Nature, leaving it inanimate and chilly.
Fourthly, like the earlier Emperors, he deemed Christianity
anti-social, and the Christian potentially and probably, if not
actually, a bad citizen of the Empire. Fifthly, he hated the
aggressive intolerance of Christianity, its inability to live and let
live, its polemical paroxysms, and iconoclastic frenzies....
These were the main elements in his anti-Christianity; and yet
they are not, taken together, quite sufficient to account for the
measureless scorn with which he invariably speaks of ‘Galileans.’
One cannot but feel that Christianity must have done him some
personal injury, not clearly known to us. Was he simply humiliated
by the hypocrisy he had had to practise in his boyhood
and youth? Or was Ibsen right in divining some painful mystery
behind his certainly unsatisfactory relations with his Christian
consort, Helena?”</p>

betray uneasiness and debility. Beside

pale, delicate woman, the same age as the Emperor.

Julian</span>, a not yet fully developed youth of nineteen.
He has black hair and the beginnings of a
beard, sparkling brown eyes with a rapid glance;
his court-dress sits badly upon him; his manners
are notably awkward and abrupt. The Emperor’s
sister, the <span class='sc'>Princess Helena</span>, a voluptuous beauty
of twenty-five, follows, accompanied by maidens
and older women. Courtiers and men-at-arms

myself seen the stars break from their spheres,
plunge down towards earth, and burn out on the

<p class='c001'>Since then he has lectured here, the philosopher,
the orator. All proclaim him the king of
eloquence; and well they may. I tell you he is
terrible. Youths and men flock around him; he
binds their souls in bonds, so that they must follow
him; denial flows seductively from his lips,

such a sin. Should any rumours come to your
ears, believe them not. ’Tis not true that I have
sought out Libanius by night, in disguise. All
contact with him would be a horror to me. Besides,
the Emperor has forbidden it, and Hekebolius
still more strictly.—All believers who
approach that subtle man fall away and turn to
scoffers. And not they alone. His words are
borne from mouth to mouth, even into the
Emperor’s palace. His airy mockery, his incontrovertible
arguments, his very lampoons seem to
blend with my prayers;—they are to me like those
monsters in the shape of birds who befouled all
the food of a pious wandering hero of yore. I
sometimes feel with horror that my gorge rises at
the true meat of the Word—— [<i>With an irrepressible

send you the head of Libanius on a charger!</p>

and piety! But the Emperor has no thoughts
for anything but this luckless Persian war. All
minds are full of it. No one heeds the war that
is being waged here, against the Prince of Golgotha.
Ah, my Agathon, it is not now as it was
two years ago. Then the two brothers of the
Mystic Maximus had to pay for their heresies with
their lives. You do not know what mighty allies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Libanius has. One or other of the lesser philosophers
is now and then driven from the city; on
him no one dares lay a finger. I have begged, I
have implored both Hekebolius and the Empress
to procure his banishment. But no, no!—What
avails it to drive away the others? This one man
poisons the air for all of us. Oh, thou my Saviour,
if I could but flee from all this abomination of
heathendom! To live here is to live in the lion’s
den——</p>

to fear and yet to long for. What should hinder
him from reaching so honourable an eminence?
He lacks nothing but to pass through the same
school through which Paul passed, and passed so
unscathed that, when he afterwards joined the
Galileans, he shed more light than all the other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>apostles together, because he possessed knowledge
and eloquence! Hekebolius fears for his pupil’s
faith. Oh, I know it well; the fear is his. Does
he forget then, in his exceeding tenderness of
conscience, that he himself, in his youth, has
drunk of those very springs from which he would
now have his pupil debarred? Or think you
it was not from us that he learned to use the

with the gifts which declared themselves so
marvellously in that princely boy, who, it is said,
in Cappadocia, upon the graves of the slain Galileans,
proclaimed a doctrine which I hold to be
erroneous, and by so much the more difficult to
instil, but which he nevertheless proclaimed
with such fervour of spirit that—if I may believe
a very widespread rumour—a multitude of children
of his own age were carried away by
him, and followed him as his disciples! Ah,
Hekebolius is like the rest of you—more jealous
than zealous; that is why Libanius has waited in

say you, my Julian? I call it lack of gold. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>I will turn this lack of gold to account, and out
of it I will mint for you young men a coin of
true and weighty metal. For may not a precious
lesson in life, set forth in ingenious and attractive
form, be compared to a piece of full-weighted
golden currency?—</p>

<p class='c001'>Hear then, if you have a mind to. Was it not
said that certain men had rushed eagerly down to
the Piraeus? Who are they, these eager ones?
Far be it from me to mention names; they call
themselves lovers and teachers of wisdom. Let
us betake ourselves in thought to the Piraeus.
What is passing there at this moment, even as I
stand here in this circle of kindly listeners? I
will tell you what is passing. Those men who
give themselves out as lovers and dispensers of
wisdom, are crowding upon the gangway, jostling,
wrangling, biting, forgetting all decorum, and
throwing dignity to the winds. And why? To
be the first in the field,—to pounce upon the best
dressed youths, to lead them home, to entertain
them, hoping in the end to make profit out of
them in all possible ways. What a shamefaced,
empty awakening, as after a debauch, if it should
presently appear—ha-ha-ha!—that these youths
have scarcely brought with them the wherewithal
to pay for their supper of welcome! Learn from
this, young men, how ill it becomes a lover of
wisdom, and how little it profits him, to run after
good things other than the truth.</p>

tremors of joy did I not enter the presence of
this man, bowing myself before him, kissing him,
and calling him my great <a id='corr70.28'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='brother'>brother.</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_70.28'><ins class='correction' title='brother'>brother.</ins></a></span></p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Julian.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And yet I came here in exaltation of spirit. I
saw, in my fancy, a mighty contest between us
two,—the world’s truth in pitched battle against
God’s truth.—What has it all come to? Libanius
never seriously desired that contest. He never
desired any contest whatever; he cares only for
his own interest. I tell you, Gregory—Libanius
is not a great man.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>A great man he is not, I tell you. Once only
have I seen Libanius great: that night in Constantinople.
Then he was great, because he had
suffered a great wrong, and because he was filled
with a noble wrath. But here! Oh, what have
I not seen here? Libanius has great learning, but
he is no great man. Libanius is greedy; he is
vain; he is eaten up with envy. See you not how
he has writhed under the fame which I—largely,
no doubt, owing to the indulgence of my friends—have
been so fortunate as to acquire? Go to
Libanius, and he will expound to you the inward
essence and the outward signs of all the virtues.
He has them ready to hand, just as he has the
books in his library. But does he exercise these
virtues? Is his life at one with his teaching? He
a successor of Socrates and of Plato—ha-ha! Did
he not flatter the Emperor, up to the time of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>banishment? Did he not flatter me at our meeting
in Constantinople, that meeting which he has
since attempted, most unsuccessfully, to present
in a ludicrous light! And what am I to him now?
Now he writes letters to Gallus, to Gallus Caesar,
to the Emperor’s heir, congratulating him on his
successes against the Persians, although these successes
have as yet been meagre enough, and
Gallus Caesar is not distinguished either for learning
or for any considerable eloquence.—And this
Libanius the Greeks persist in calling the king of
the philosophers! Ah, I will not deny that it
stirs my indignation. I should have thought, to
tell the truth, that the Greeks might have made
a better choice, if they had noted a little more
closely the cultivators of wisdom and eloquence,
who of late years——</p>

it, this Christendom that I am to save? With the

cry out, “No, no!” Among the powerful and
high-born;—among those sensual and effeminate
courtiers who fold their hands over their full
bellies, and quaver: “Was the Son of God created
out of nothing?” Or among the men of enlightenment,

drunk in beauty and learning from the heathen

greatly favours?—And then the whole ragged
rabble of the Empire, who rage against the temples,
who massacre heathens and the children of heathens!
Is it for Christ’s sake? Ha ha! see how
they fall to fighting among themselves for the
spoils of the slain.—Ask Makrina if Christendom
is to be sought in the wilderness,—on the pillar
where the stylite-saint stands on one leg? Or is
it in the cities? Perhaps among those bakers in
Constantinople who lately took to their fists to
decide whether the Trinity consists of three individuals
or of three hypostases!—Which of all these
would Christ acknowledge if he came down to
earth again?—Out with your Diogenes-lantern,

not Plato—and we others after him—shed the

as though a storm-wind filled the house; the
curtain was swept flapping aloft, and I looked out
into the night, far over the sea. I heard sweet
singing; and the singers were two large birds,
with women’s faces. They flew slanting towards
the shore; there they dropped gently earthwards;
the bird-forms melted away like a white mist, and,
in a soft, glimmering light, I saw you two.</p>

<p class='c001'>How dare you judge of these hidden things?
They are beyond your learning, my Gregory!
Fearful is the way into the glory of glories. Those
dreamers in Eleusis were near the right track;
Maximus found it, and I after him—by his help.
I have wandered through chasms of darkness. A
dead swampy water lay on my left—I believe it
was a stream that had forgotten to flow. Piercing
voices shrilled through the night confusedly, suddenly,
and, as it were, without cause. Now and
then I saw a bluish light; dreadful shapes floated
past me;—I went on and on in deathly fear; but
I endured the trial to the end.—</p>

<p class='c001'>Since then—oh, beloved ones—with this my
body transformed to spirit, I have passed far into
the land of paradise; I have heard the angels
chant their hymns of praise; I have gazed at the
midmost light——</p>

<p class='c001'>Blindness, blindness! Maximus pays homage
to his precursor and brother—to both his great
brothers, the law-giver of Sinai and the seer of
Nazareth.——</p>

<p class='c001'>Would you know how the spirit of realisation
filled me?—It happened on a night of prayer and
fasting. I perceived that I was wafted far—far
out into space, and beyond time; for there was
broad and sun-shimmering day around me, and I
stood alone on a ship, with drooping sails, in the
midst of the glassy, gleaming Aegean sea. Islands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>towered aloft in the distance, like dim, still banks
of clouds, and the ship lay heavily, as though
sleeping, upon the wine-blue plain.—</p>

<p class='c001'>Then behold! the plain became more and more
transparent, lighter, thinner; at last, it was no
longer there, and my ship hung over a fearful,
empty abyss. No verdure down there, no sunlight,—only
the dead, black, slimy bottom of the
sea, in all its ghastly nakedness.——</p>

<p class='c001'>But above, in the boundless dome, which before
had seemed to me empty,—there was life; there
invisibility clothed itself in form, and silence
became sound.—Then I grasped the great redeeming
realisation.</p>

arose, and went out from his house; and lo! there

and bade him make ready a purple robe, such as
newly-chosen rulers wear. But when Apollinaris,
in affright, would have declined so dangerous a
task, the apparition vanished, and only a voice
cried: “Go, go, Apollinaris, and speedily prepare
the purple robe.”</p>

wife died in Bithynia. Constantina has always
been his bad angel; therefore she had to be removed,
in accordance with the change in the

death, the Emperor’s emissary, the tribune Scudilo,
came with a great retinue to Antioch, greeted
Gallus Caesar with imperial honours, and invited
him, in the Emperor’s name, to visit the imperial
camp at Rome.—Caesar’s journey from province
to province is now like a conqueror’s progress. In
Constantinople he has held races in the hippodrome,
and the multitude loudly acclaimed him
when he, though as yet but Caesar by title,
stood forth after the manner of the earlier
Emperors, and gave the crown to Corax, the

<p class='c001'>What you slavishly hope for after death, ’tis
the aim of the great mystery to win for all the
initiated, here in our earthly life. ’Tis regeneration
that Maximus and his disciples seek,—’tis our
lost likeness to the godhead. Wherefore so full
of doubt, my brothers? Why do you stand there
as though before something insurmountable? I
know what I know. In each successive generation
there has been one soul wherein the pure Adam
has been born again; he was strong in Moses the
lawgiver; in the Macedonian Alexander he had
power to subdue the world; he was well-nigh
perfect in Jesus of Nazareth. But see, Basil—[<i>He
grasps him by the arm</i>]—all of them lacked what is
promised to <em class='gesperrt'>me</em>—the pure woman!</p>

<p class='c001'>Why all this scornful doubt? Is it my small
stature that witnesses against me? Ha, ha; I
tell you this gross and fleshly generation shall pass
away. That which is to come shall be conceived
rather in the soul than in the body. In the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>Adam, soul and body were equally balanced, as in
those statues of the god Apollo. Since then the
balance has been lost. Was not Moses tongue-tied?
Had not his arms to be supported when he
held them up in imprecation, there by the Red Sea?
Did not the Macedonian need ever to be fired
by strong drinks and other artificial aids? And
Jesus of Nazareth, too? Was he not feeble in
body? Did he not fall asleep in the ship, whilst
the others kept awake? Did he not faint under
the cross, that cross which the Jew Simon carried
with ease? The two thieves did not faint.—You
call yourselves believers, and yet have so little
faith in miraculous revelation. Wait, wait—you
shall see; the Bride shall surely be given me; and
then—hand in hand will we go forth to the east,
where some say that Helios is born,—we will hide
ourselves in the solitudes, as the godhead hides
itself, seek out the grove on the banks of Euphrates,
find it, and there—oh glory of glories!—thence
shall a new race, perfect in beauty and in balance,
go forth over the earth; there, ye book-worshipping
doubters, there shall the empire of the spirit
be founded!</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Who, think you, are my friends in the army? I
have not one, my beloved Helena! Yes, one single
man—the knight Sallust, of Perusia, to whom, during
our marriage feast at Milan, I had to refuse a
slight request. He magnanimously came to me in
the camp, appealed to our old friendship in Athens,
and begged leave to stand at my side in all dangers.
But what does Sallust count for at the imperial
court? He is one of those whom they call heathens.
He can be of no help to me.—And the others!
Arbetio, the tribune, who left me in the lurch when
I was blockaded by the Senones! Old Severus,
burdened with the sense of his own impotence, yet
unable to reconcile himself to my new strategy!
Or think you I can depend on Florentius, the
captain of the Praetorians? I tell you, that turbulent
man is filled with the most unbridled ambitions.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Pacing up and down.</i>] If I could but come to the

pass between the camp and Rome. Everything I
do is set down and distorted. No slave in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>empire is so fettered as Caesar. Would you believe
it, Helena, even my cook has to abide by a bill of
fare sent to him by the Emperor; I may not alter
it, either by adding or countermanding a single
dish!</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>Julian.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Rumour could not exaggerate.—Hush; what
was that? [<i>Listening towards the door.</i>] No, no; I
only thought——</p>

<p class='c001'>I may say that in these months I have done all
that mortal man could do. Step by step, and in
spite of all hindrances in my own camp, I drove
the barbarians back towards the eastern frontier.
Before Argentoratum, with the Rhine at his back,
King Knodomar gathered all his forces together.
He was joined by five kings and ten lesser princes.
But before he had collected the necessary boats
for his retreat in case of need, I led my army to
the attack.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Lupicinus, with the spearmen and the light-armed
troops, outflanked the enemy on the north;
the old legions, under Severus, drove the barbarians
more and more to the eastward, towards
the river; our allies, the Batavians, under the
faithful Bainabaudes, stood gallantly by the
legions; and when Knodomar saw that his case
was desperate, he tried to make off southwards, in
order to reach the islands. But before he could
escape, I sent Florentius to intercept him with the
Praetorian guards and the cavalry. Helena, I
dare not say it aloud, but certain it is that
treachery or envy had nearly robbed me of the
fruits of victory. The Roman cavalry recoiled
time after time before the barbarians, who threw
themselves down on the ground and stabbed the
horses in the belly. Defeat stared us in the
face——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Julian.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I seized a standard, fired the Imperial Guards
by my shouts, made them a hasty address, which
was, perhaps, not quite unworthy of a more enlightened
audience, and then, rewarded by the
soldiers’ acclamations, I plunged headlong into
the thickest of the fight.</p>

<p class='c001'>At that moment you were not in my thoughts.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>I wished to die; for I despaired of victory. But
it came, my love! It seemed as though lightnings
of terror flashed from our lance-points. I saw
Knodomar, that redoutable warrior—ah, you have
seen him too—I saw him fleeing on foot from the
battlefield, and with him his brother Vestralp, and
the kings Hortar and Suomar, and all who had
not fallen by our swords.</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>Julian.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Never have I heard such shrieks of despair;
never seen such gaping wounds as those we
trampled on, as we waded through the slain. The
river did the rest; the drowning men struggled
among themselves until they rolled over, and went
to the bottom. Most of the princes fell living
into our hands; Knodomar himself had sought
refuge in a bed of reeds; one of his attendants
betrayed him, and our bowmen sent a shower of
arrows into his hiding-place, but without hitting
him. Then, of his own accord, he gave himself
up.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Hesitatingly.</i>] On the very evening of the

<p class='c001'>I prefer to call it so. In Athens we used to
speculate much upon Nemesis.—My victory was

were, got out of balance; I do not know——</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Julian.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It was a trifle, I tell you. I ordered the captive
Knodomar to be brought before me, in the presence
of the army. Before the battle, he had
threatened that I should be flayed alive when I
fell into his hands. Now he came towards me
with faltering steps, trembling in every limb.
Crushed by disaster, as the barbarians are apt to
be, he cast himself down before me, embraced my
knees, shed tears, and begged for his life.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Helena.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>His mighty frame quivering with dread—I can

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Julian.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I could not kill that man. I granted him his

    <div><span class='sc'>Julian.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>Prudence bade me deal mercifully with him.
But then—I cannot tell how it happened—with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>cry of overflowing gladness, the barbarian sprang
up, stretched his pinioned hands into the air, and,
half ignorant as he is of our language, shouted
with a loud voice: “Praise be to thee, Julian,
thou mighty Emperor!”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>My attendants were inclined to laugh; but the
barbarian’s shout flew like a lightning-flash through
the surrounding soldiery, kindling as it went.
“Long live the Emperor Julian,” those who stood
nearest repeated; and the cry spread around in
wider and ever wider circles to the furthest distance.
’Twas as though some Titan had hurled a
mighty rock far out into the ocean;—oh, my

nothing in Gaul. It was, as I told

that the imminent danger to the empire

him. <em class='gesperrt'>My</em> name is not fortunate enough to find
any place in this document,—nor yours, Florentius,
nor yours, Severus! And here, in the description
of the battle of Argentoratum—where was it?
Yes, here it stands!—it was the Emperor who
determined the order of battle; it was the Emperor
himself who, at peril of his life, fought
till his sword was blunted, in the forefront of the
battle: it was the Emperor who, by the terror of
his presence, put the barbarians to headlong

<p class='c001'>That is right, my brothers in arms; let us all
agree to swallow our vainglory. I asked what was
lacking to complete Caesar’s happiness. Now you
know it. ’Twas the recognition of the truth that
was lacking in Caesar’s happiness. Your silver
helmet will never be dimmed with the dust of
the triumph, Florentius! The Emperor has already
triumphed for us, in Rome. He therefore declares
all festivities here to be superfluous. Go, Sintula,
and see that the intended procession is countermanded.
The Emperor wishes to give his soldiers
a much-needed rest. ’Tis his will that they remain
in the camp outside the walls.</p>

I recalled to you the old friendship of our
Athenian days,—when I begged to share with

<p class='c001'>My mind had for some time been inflamed
against you. You remember that little variance
in Milan—yet no little one for me, who had hoped
that Caesar would help to restore my waning fortunes.
Of all this they took advantage in Rome;
they regarded me as the very man to spy out your
doings.</p>

<p class='c001'>I was ruined, my lord; and I thought Caesar
had forsaken me. Yes, my Caesar, I betrayed
you——, during the first few months; but not
afterwards. Your friendliness, your magnanimity,
all the favour you showed me——; I became, what
I had professed to be, your faithful adherent; and
in my secret letters to Rome I put my employers
on false scents.</p>

What others may have written, I know not; I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>only know that I often enough groaned in anguish
under my enforced and hated silence. I ventured
as far as I by any means dared. That letter
written to an unnamed man in your camp, which
contained an account of the Emperor’s triumphal
entry in Rome, and which you found one morning
on the march to Lutetia pushed under your tent-flap——;
you did find it, my lord?</p>

<p class='c001'>That was directed to me, and chance favoured
me in bringing it into your hands. I dared not

from day to day the confession of my shame. Oh,

You are right, Sallust; his decay gives no room

will pour out the blood of my friends. Yes, who

not that harmless captive pay with his life for an
error of language? For—I know it, Sallust—they
killed him; that tale about the barbarian’s home-sickness
was a lie. Then what may not we expect?

<p class='c001'>And what will be the fate of the empire should
I waver now? A decrepit Emperor, and after him
a helpless child, upon the throne; faction and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>revolt; every man’s hand against his neighbour,
in the struggle for power.—Not many nights ago
I saw a vision. A figure appeared before me, with
a halo round its head; it looked wrathfully upon
me, and said: “Choose!” With that it vanished
away, like morning mist. Hitherto I had interpreted
it as referring to something far different;
but now that I know of the Emperor’s approaching
marriage——</p>

<p class='c001'>Yes, indeed, it is time to choose, ere misfortune
overwhelms the empire. I am not thinking of
my own interest; but <em class='gesperrt'>dare</em> I shirk the choice,
Sallust? Is it not my duty to the Emperor to
defend my life? Have I a right to stand with
folded arms and await the murderers whom he, in
his mad panic, is bribing to hew me down? Have
I a right to give this unhappy Constantius an
opportunity of heaping fresh blood-guiltiness upon
his sinful head? Were it not better for him—as
the Scriptures say—that he should suffer wrong
rather than do wrong? If, therefore, this
that I do to my kinsman can be called a wrong, I
hold that the wrong is wiped out by the fact that
it hinders my kinsman from inflicting a wrong on
me. I think that both Plato and Marcus Aurelius,
that crowned bridegroom of wisdom, would support
me in that. At any rate, it would be no unworthy
problem for the philosophers, my dear Sallust!—Oh
that I had Libanius here!</p>

<p class='c001'>True, true; yet I would fain hear the views

not think that! Nor do I see any reason to doubt
a favourable issue. For those omens should by
no means discourage us. The fact that I retained
the handle, when my shield broke during the
games, may with ample reason, I think, be taken
to mean that I shall succeed in holding what my
hand has grasped. And if, in vaulting upon my
horse, I overthrew the man who helped me to
mount, may not this portend a sudden fall to
Constantius, to whom I owe my rise? Be this as
it may, my Sallust, I look forward to composing

all; Gallus was spared, and I;—a couple of lives
must be left wherewith to buy himself a little
pardon. Then he drifted into the current of suspicion
again. Remorse wrung from him the title

<p class='c001'>No, you are right. The priests——! My whole
youth has been one long dread of the Emperor and
of Christ. Oh, he is terrible, that mysterious—that
merciless god-man! At every turn, wheresoever
I wished to go, he met me, stark and stern,
with his unconditional, inexorable commands.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Always without. Always “Thou shalt.” If my
soul gathered itself up in one gnawing and consuming
hate towards the murderer of my kin,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>what said the commandment: “Love thine
enemy!” If my mind, athirst for beauty, longed
for scenes and rites from the bygone world of
Greece, Christianity swooped down on me with its
“Seek the one thing needful!” If I felt the
sweet lusts of the flesh towards this or that, the
Prince of Renunciation terrified me with his:
“Kill the body that the soul may live!”—All that
is human has become unlawful since the day when
the seer of Galilee became ruler of the world.
Through him, life has become death. Love and
hatred, both are sins. Has he, then, transformed
man’s flesh and blood? Has not earth-bound man
remained what he ever was? Our inmost, healthy
soul rebels against it all;—and yet we are to will
in the very teeth of our own will! Thou shalt,
shalt, shalt!</p>

<p class='c001'>Did not Libanius remain the man he was,
whether he took the affirmative in a disputation,
or the negative? This lies deeper. Here it is
action that must be faced. “Render unto Caesar
the things that are Caesar’s.” In Athens I once
made a game of that;—but it is no game. You
cannot grasp it, you, who have never been under
the power of the god-man. It is more than a
doctrine he has spread over the world; it is an
enchantment, that binds the soul in chains. He
who has once been under it,—I believe he can
never quite shake it off.</p>

<p class='c001'>Word-froth from the lecture-halls! You can no

no, no, Maximus! But you cannot understand
how it is with us. We are like vines transplanted

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Be that as it may. But do you not see that this
paralysing terror has curdled and coiled itself up
into a wall around the Emperor? Ah, I see very
well why the great Constantine promoted such a
will-binding doctrine to power and authority in
the empire. No bodyguard with spears and
shields could form such a bulwark round the
throne as this benumbing creed, for ever pointing
beyond our earthly life. Have you looked closely
at these Christians? Hollow-eyed, pale-cheeked,
flat-breasted, all; they are like the linen-weavers
of Byssus; they brood their lives away unspurred
by ambition; the sun shines for them, and they
do not see it; the earth offers them its fulness, and
they desire it not;—all their desire is to renounce
and suffer, that they may come to die.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then use them as they are; but you yourself
must stand without. Emperor or Galilean;—<em class='gesperrt'>that</em>
is the alternative. Be a thrall under the
terror, or monarch in the land of sunshine and
gladness! You cannot will contradictions; and
yet that is what you would fain do. You try to
unite what cannot be united,—to reconcile two
irreconcilables; therefore it is that you lie here
rotting in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c001'>My beloved Julian, look at the world around
you! Those death-desiring Christians you speak
of are fewest of the few. And how is it with all
the others? Are not their minds falling away
from the Master, one by one? Answer me,—what
has become of this strange gospel of love?
Does not sect rage against sect? And the bishops,
those gold-bedecked magnates, who call themselves
the chief shepherds of the church! Do
they yield even to the great men of the court in
greed and ambition and sycophancy——?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Julian.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>They are not all like that; think of the great

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Maximus.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Athanasius stood alone. And where is Athanasius
now? Did they not drive him out, because
he would not sell himself to serve the Emperor’s
will? Was he not forced to take refuge in the
Libyan desert, where he was devoured by lions?
And can you name me <em class='gesperrt'>one</em> other like Athanasius?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>Think of Maris, the bishop of Chalcedon, who has
now changed sides three times in the Arian controversy.
Think of old Bishop Marcus, of Arethusa;
him you know from your boyhood. Has
he not lately, in the teeth of both law and justice,
taken all municipal property from the citizens, and
transferred it to the church? And remember the
feeble, vacillating Bishop of Nazianzus, who is
the laughing-stock of his own community, because
he answers yes and no in the same cause, in the
hope to please both parties.</p>

<p class='c001'>These are your brothers in arms, my Julian; you
will find none better among them. Or perhaps
you count upon those two great Galilean lights
that were to be, in Cappadocia? Ha-ha; Gregory,
the bishop’s son, pleads causes in his native town,
and Basil, on his estate in the far east, is buried
in the writings of secular philosophers.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, I know it well. On all sides they fall
away! Hekebolius, my former teacher, has grown
rich through his zeal for the faith, and his expositions
of it; and since then——! Maximus—it

earnestness.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>that you can do anything for a cause which has
despaired of itself. You will be beaten, I tell
you! And where will you turn then? Disowned
by Constantius, you will be disowned by all other
powers on earth,—and over the earth. Or will
you flee to the Galilean’s bosom? How stands the
account between you and him? Did you not own,
a moment ago, that you are under the terror?
Have you his commands within you? Do you love
your enemy, Constantius, even if you do not smite
him? Do you hate the lusts of the flesh or the
alluring joys of this world, even if you do not,
like a heated swimmer, plunge into their depths?
Do you renounce the world, because you have not
courage to make it your own? And are you so

yonder?</p>

it. Be on the alert night and day for the common
welfare. Be masters in name, and yet servants to
civic freedom. Choose the foremost places in
battle, and not at the feasts. Take nothing for
yourselves, but lavish gifts upon all. Let your
justice be equally remote from laxity and from
inhumanity. Live so that no virgin on earth shall
wring her hands because of you. Bid defiance—both
to impenetrable Gaul, and inhospitable
Germany. What would they answer? Appalled

As for me, I dare not build my hopes on a god

I know by infallible signs and tokens
that the victories I won on the Gallic frontier I
owe to those other divinities who favoured Alexander
in a somewhat similar way. Under watch
and ward of these divinities, I passed unscathed
through all dangers; and, in especial, it was they
who furthered my journey hither with such marvellous
speed and success that, as I gathered from
cries in the streets, some people have come to
look upon me as a divine being,—which is a great
exaggeration, my friends! But certain it is, that
I dare not show myself ungrateful for such untiring

rulers of old erected with such admirable art, shall
rise again in rejuvenated splendour, with altars
and statues, each for its especial God, so that
seemly worship may once more be offered them.
But I will by no means tolerate any vengeful
assaults upon the churches of the Christians;
neither shall their graveyards be molested, nor
any other places which a strange delusion leads
them to regard as sacred. We will bear with the
errors of others; I myself have laboured under
illusions;—but over that I cast a veil. What I
have thought upon things divine since my one-and-twentieth

rites of our forefathers. I have inquired high and
low, but scarcely a single person have I found who
could speak with authority as to the ceremonies
to be observed in sacrificing to Apollo or Fortuna.
I must take the lead in this, as in other matters.
It has cost me many sleepless nights to search out
in the ancient records what tradition prescribes in

this suit of mail, begging you to wear it in battle
against the foes of the empire, although he knows
that you, invincible hero, stand under the protecting
eye of the gods, who will suffer no weapon of
mortal man to wound you.—Here are priceless
carpets, tents, and saddle-housings from the
princes beyond the Tigris. They thereby acknowledge
that, if the gods have granted those lands
exceeding riches, it was with the design that these
riches should be at the service of their favourite.—The
King of Serandib, and likewise the King
of Diu, send you these weapons, sword, spear, and
shield, with bows and arrows; for, they say, “We
esteem it wisest to stand unarmed before the victorious
lord who, like a divinity, has shown himself
so mighty as to overwhelm all opposition.”—In
return, all pray for the supreme favour of your
friendship, and especially beg that if, as report
says, you propose next spring to annihilate the
audacious Persian king, you will spare their territories
from hostile invasion.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such an embassy cannot come quite as a surprise
to me. The gifts shall be deposited in my
treasury, and through you I apprise your masters
that it is my will to maintain friendship with all
nations who do not—whether by force or guile—thwart
my designs.—As to your being led, in your
distant lands, to regard me as a divinity on account
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>of my fortunate victories, I will not enter further
into the matter. I reverence the gods too highly
to arrogate to myself an unmerited place in their
midst, although I know that frequently, and chiefly
in the days of old, there have lived heroes and
rulers who have been so greatly distinguished by
the favour and grace of the gods, that it has been
difficult to determine whether they should rightly
be reckoned among mortals or immortals. Of
such things, however, it is rash to judge, even for
us Greeks. How much more, then, for you?
Therefore, enough of that.—Eutherius conduct
the strangers to repose, and see that they lack
nothing.</p>

no divinity has been so much misunderstood—ay,

whom the Romans also call Bacchus. Think
you he is the god of sots? Oh ignorant creatures,
I pity you, if that is your thought. Who but he
inspires poets and prophets with their miraculous
gifts? I know that some attribute this function
to Apollo, and certainly not without a show of
reason; but in that case the whole matter must

<p class='c001'>[<i>Addressing the assemblage.</i>] So great success
have the gods vouchsafed me. Hardly a single
city have I approached on my journey, whence
whole troops of Galileans have not streamed forth
to meet me on the road, lamenting their errors,
and placing themselves under the protection of
the divine powers. Compared with this, what
signifies the senseless behaviour of the scoffers?
May not the scoffers be likened to dogs, who in
their ignorance yelp at the moon? Yet I will not
deny that I have learned with indignation that
some inhabitants of this city have spoken scornfully
of the rule of life which I have enjoined on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>the priests of Cybele, the good goddess. Ought
not reverence for so exalted a divinity to protect
her servants from mockery? I say to those foolhardy
men: Are ye barbarians, since ye know not
who Cybele is? Must I solemnly remind you how,
when the power of Rome was so gravely threatened
by that Punic commander, whose grave I saw not
long since in Libyssa, the Cumaean Sybil counselled
that the statue of Cybele should be taken
from the temple in Pessinus, and brought to Rome?
As to the priests’ way of life, some have wondered
that they should be forbidden to eat roots,
and everything that grows along the earth, while
they are allowed to partake of upward-growing
herbs and fruits. Oh, how dense is your ignorance—I
pity you if you cannot understand this!
Can the spirit of man find nourishment in that
which creeps along the ground? Does not the soul
live by all that yearns upward, towards heaven and
the sun? I will not enter more largely into these
matters to-day. What remains to be said you
shall learn from a treatise I am composing during
my sleepless nights, which I hope will shortly be
recited both in the lecture-halls and on the
market-places.</p>

<p class='c001'>That is well, my friends; rejoice that I have
succeeded in making a not altogether unworthy
beginning to this day, which is specially dedicate to
the feast of the radiant Apollo. For is it not worthy
of a philosopher to overlook affronts against
himself, whilst he sternly chastises wrongs done
to the immortal gods? I do not recall whether that
crowned cultivator of learning, Marcus Aurelius,
was ever in like case; but if he was, we must hope
that he did not act quite unlike me, who hold
it an honour to follow humbly in his footsteps.</p>

<p class='c001'>Let this serve as a clue for your future guidance.
In the palace, in the market-place, even in the
theatre—did I not loathe to enter such a place of
folly—it is fit that you should greet me with
acclamation and joyful applause. Such homage,
I know, was well received both by the Macedonian
Alexander and by Julius Caesar, men who were
also permitted by the Goddess of Fortune to
outshine other mortals in glory.</p>

<p class='c001'>But when you see me entering a temple, that is
another affair. Then I desire you to be silent, or
direct your plaudits to the gods, and not to me, as
I advance with bent head and downcast eyes. And
above all, I trust you will be heedful of this to-day,
when I am to sacrifice to so transcendent and
mighty a divinity as he whom we know by the
name of the Sun-King, and who seems even
greater in our eyes when we reflect that he is the
same whom certain oriental peoples call Mithra.</p>

<p class='c001'>You know what were my thoughts of things divine,
during our happy comradeship in Athens. But
then it was far from my purpose to renounce the
joys of life. Neither ambition nor the thirst for
riches, I can truly say, has ever tempted me; yet
I should scarce tell the truth if I denied that my
eye and my mind dwelt wonderingly on all the
glories which the old learning and art of Greece
revealed to me. The wranglings and petty schisms
in our church afflicted me deeply; but I took no
part in them; I served my countrymen in temporal
things; nothing more——</p>

<p class='c001'>Then came tidings from Constantinople. It was
said that Constantius had died of terror at your
proceedings, and had declared you his heir.
Heralded by the renown of your victories, and
received as a superhuman being, you, the hero of
Gaul and Germany, had ascended the throne of
Constantine without striking a blow. The earth
lay at your feet.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nevita is zealous in his duty, and I cannot myself

sincerely, and I deeply deplore that neither
time nor circumstances allowed me to examine
into his case myself. I should certainly have
spared him, Gregory! I have thought, too, of

behind.</p>

<p class='c001'>Great Emperor, you owe me no reckoning for
your acts. I only wished to tell you that all these
tidings fell like thunderbolts in Caesarea and
Nazianzus, and the other Cappadocian cities. How
shall I describe their effect! Our internal wranglings
were silenced by the common danger. Many
rotten branches of the Church fell away; but in
many indifferent hearts the light of the Lord was
kindled with a fervour before undreamt-of. Meanwhile
oppression overtook God’s people. The
heathen—I mean, my Emperor, those whom <i>I</i> call
heathen—began to threaten, to injure, to persecute
us——</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Julian.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>Retaliation,—retaliation, Gregory!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregory.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Far be it from me to justify all that my fellow
Christians may have done in their excessive zeal
for the cause of the Church. But you, who are
so enlightened, and have power over all alike,
cannot permit the living to suffer for the faults of
the dead. Yet so it has been in Cappadocia. The
enemies of the Christians, few in number, but
thirsting after gain, and burning with eagerness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>to ingratiate themselves with the new officials,
have awakened fear and perturbation among the
people both in town and country.</p>

<p class='c001'>I am not thinking chiefly of the insults we have
had to suffer, nor of the infringements of our just
rights of property, to which we have been constantly
exposed of late. What most grieves me
and all my earnest brethren, is the peril to souls.
Many are not firm-rooted in the faith, and cannot
quite shake off the care for earthly goods. The
harsh treatment which has now to be endured by
all who bear the name of Christian has already led
to more than one apostasy. Sire, this is soul-robbery
from God’s kingdom.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Julian.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, my wise Gregory,—how can you talk so? I
wonder at you? Should you not rather, as a good
Galilean, rejoice that your community is rid of
such men?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregory.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Gracious Emperor, I am not of that opinion. I
have myself been indifferent in the faith, and I
look upon all such as sick men, who are not past
cure, so long as they remain in the bosom of the
Church. So, too, thought our little congregation
at Nazianzus. Brethren and sisters, in deep distress,
assembled to take counsel against the perils
of the time. They were joined by delegates from
Caesarea and other cities. My father is infirm,
and—as he owns with sorrow—does not possess
the steadfast, immovable will which, in these
troublous times, is needful for him who sits in the
bishop’s chair. The assembly determined that a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>younger man should be chosen as his helper, to

<p class='c001'>I was then away on a journey. But in my
absence, and without consulting me, my father
ordained me a priest and sent me the priestly
habit.</p>

<p class='c001'>These tidings reached me in Tiberina, at my
country house, where I was passing some days
with my brother and with the friend of my youth,
Basil of Caesarea.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sire—had my sentence of death been read to
me, it could not have appalled me more than
this.</p>

<p class='c001'>I a priest! I wished it, and I wished it not. I
felt it must be—and yet my courage failed. I
wrestled with God the Lord, as the patriarch
wrestled with him in the days of the old covenant.
What passed in my soul during the night which
followed, I cannot tell. But this I know that, ere
the cock crew, I talked face to face with the
Crucified One.—Then I was his.</p>

<p class='c001'>On my homeward journey I passed through
Caesarea. Oh, what misery met me there! I
found the town full of fugitive country people,
who had forsaken house and home because the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>drought had burnt up their crops, and laid all the
vineyards and olive-gardens desolate. To escape
starvation they had fled to the starving. There
they lay—men, women, and children—in heaps
along the walls of the houses; fever shook them,
famine gnawed their entrails. What had Caesarea
to offer them—that impoverished, unhappy town,
as yet but half rebuilt after the great earthquake
of two years ago? And in the midst of this, amid
scorching heat and frequent earthquake-shocks,
we had to see ungodly festivals going on day and
night. The ruined altars were hastily rebuilt; the
blood of sacrifices ran in streams; mummers
and harlots paraded the streets with dance and
song.</p>

<p class='c001'>Sire—can you wonder that my much-tried
brethren thought they saw in the visitation that
had come upon them a judgment of heaven because
they had so long tolerated heathenism and its
scandalous symbols in their midst?</p>

<p class='c001'>The cry of the terror-stricken and fevered multitude
rose ever higher; they demanded that the

for Christ by ordering the destruction of what
still remains of the former glory of heathendom
in Caesarea.</p>

travellers, and you shall hear to what melancholy

laying waste our holy places. What is left? A
remnant here and there; and nothing of the
best.</p>

<p class='c001'>But with you, citizens of Antioch! Oh, my

stand within it, in unviolated beauty? Not a
corner of his altar has broken or crumbled away,
not a crack is to be seen in the stately columns.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, a treatise against you. A treatise with
which my indignation has this very night inspired
me. Think you I could be other than wroth at
your most unseemly behaviour yesterday? How
strange was the licence you allowed yourself in
the lecture-hall, in my hearing, and that of many
other earnest men? Had we not to listen for
hours together to the shameful fables about the
gods which you must needs retail? How dared
you repeat such fictions? Were they not lies,
from first to last?</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>What else? Oh, I cannot express the indignation
that seized me when I understood whither
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>your impudent address was tending. “Man, let
nothing surprise you,” I was tempted to say with
the comic poet, when I heard you, like an ill-conditioned
cur, barking forth, not expressions of
gratitude, but a string of irrational nursery-tales,
and ill-written to boot. For your verses were bad,
Heraclius;—that I have proved in my treatise.</p>

<p class='c001'>How I longed to arise and leave the hall when
I saw you, as in a theatre, making a spectacle both
of Dionysus and of the great immortal after whom
you are named! If I constrained myself to keep
my seat, I can assure you ’twas more out of respect
to the players—if I dare call them so—than to the
poet. But ’twas most of all for my own sake. I
feared it might seem as though I were fleeing like
a frightened dove. Therefore I made no sign, but
quietly repeated to myself that verse of Homer:</p>

<div class='quote'>

<p class='c001'>“Bear it, my heart, for a time; heavier things
hast thou suffered.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Endure, as before, to hear a mad dog yelp at the
eternal gods.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yes, I see we must stomach this and more. We
are fallen on evil days. Show me the happy man
who has been suffered to keep his eyes and ears
uncontaminated in this iron age!</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>That is in nowise the truth! I read in the
countenances of most of you something far different
from displeasure while this shameless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>mountebank was babbling forth his ribaldries, and
then looking round the circle with a greasy smile,

<p class='c001'>That you may well be; for this is, in truth, no
trifling matter. Think you the legends of the
gods have not a serious and weighty purpose?
Are they not destined to lead the human spirit,
by an easy and pleasant path, up to the mystic
abodes where reigns the highest god,—and thereby
to make our souls capable of union with him?
How can it be otherwise? Was it not with that
view that the old poets invented such legends, and
that Plato and others repeated them, and even
added to their number? Apart from this purpose,
I tell you, these stories would be fit only for children
or barbarians,—and scarcely for them. But
was it children and barbarians, pray, that you had
before you yesterday? Where do you find the
audacity to address me as if I were a child? Do
you think yourself a sage, and entitled to a sage’s
freedom of speech, because you wear a ragged

<p class='c001'>No matter, no matter! Now you shall hear
whether I know you or not. There are among

as objects of worship.  Behold, you are like

For I am not so foolish as those others. Yes,
yes, were I not firm on that point, you would
soon overrun the whole court with your shamelessness.
Nay, do you not already do so? Are
there not many among you who would come
again, even if I drove them away? Oh my dear

of wisdom? Are you followers of Diogenes, whose

  <div class='nf-center'>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Assuredly I knew it. But when I made my

vain for Libanius. Libanius was not among
them.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The Emperor had uttered no wish to hear

<p class='c001'>Ah, Libanius, in bygone days you were not so

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Libanius.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I come where I am bidden. Ought I to be

of the Emperor’s much-honoured Maximus?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Julian.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Maximus never appears at court.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Libanius.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And for good reason. Maximus holds a court
of his own. The Emperor has conceded him a
whole palace.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Julian.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh my Libanius, have I not conceded you my
heart? How can you envy Maximus his palace?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Libanius.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I envy no man. I do not even envy my colleagues
Themistius and Mamertinus, although you have
conferred on them such signal proofs of your
favour. Nor do I envy Hekebolius, whose wealth
you have increased by such princely presents. I
even rejoice to be the only man to whom you have
given nothing. For I well know the reason of the
exception. You wish the cities of your empire to
abound in everything, and most of all in oratory,
knowing that it is that distinction which marks us
off from the barbarians. Now you feared that I,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>like certain others, might, if you gave me riches,
become lukewarm in my art. The Emperor has
therefore preferred to let the teacher of his youth
remain poor, in order to hold him the closer to
his craft. Thus do I interpret a course of action
which has astonished some whom I forbear to name.
’Tis for the honour and well-being of the state
that you have given me nothing. I am to lack
riches that I may abound in eloquence.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Julian.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And I, my Libanius, have also understood the
reason why the teacher of my youth has let me pass
many months here in Antioch without presenting
himself. Libanius doubtless deemed that any services
his former pupil may have rendered to the
gods, to the state, or to learning, were not great
enough to deserve celebration by the man who is
called the king of eloquence. Libanius no doubt
thought that meaner orators were better fitted to
deal with such trivial things. Moreover, Libanius
has remained silent out of care for the balance of
my mind. You feared, doubtless, to see the Emperor
intoxicated with arrogance, reeling like one
who in his thirst has drunk too deeply of the leaf-crowned
wine-bowl, had you lavished on him any
of that art which is the marvel of Greece, and
raised him, so to speak, to the level of the
gods, by pouring out before him so precious a
libation.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Libanius.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Ah, my Emperor, if I could believe that my
oratory possessed such power——</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span><span class='sc'>Julian.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And why should you not believe it, incomparable
friend? Oh, leave me. I am wroth with you,
Libanius. But it is the lover’s anger against the
one he loves.</p>

me then tell you that not a day has passed since
your coming hither on which I have not cursed
the steadfastness that would not let me make the
first advance. My friends assured me—not without
some show of reason—that you had undertaken
this long journey chiefly in order to see me and
hear me speak. But Julian himself gave no sign.

<p class='c001'>This meeting has been to both of us as a bath,
from which we go forth healed.</p>
<div class='c019'>[<i>They embrace and kiss again.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>And now, beloved friend, now tell me what has
brought you hither to-day; for I cannot doubt

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>To say nothing of my longing—so it is. Would
that another had been sent in my stead! But the
post of honour to which the confidence of the
citizens has summoned me makes it my duty to
perform all missions alike.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Julian.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Speak, my Libanius, and tell me how I can serve
you.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Libanius.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Let me begin by saying that the inhabitants of
this city are sunk in sorrow because you have
withdrawn your favour from them.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Julian.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>H’m——!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Libanius.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And this sorrow has been coupled with anxiety
and disquiet since Alexander, the new governor,
assumed office.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Julian.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Aha; indeed!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Libanius.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The exaltation of such a man could not but take
us by surprise. Alexander has hitherto filled only
trifling offices, and that in a manner little calculated
to earn him either the respect or the affection of
the citizens.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Julian.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I know that well, Libanius!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Libanius.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Alexander is violent in all his dealings, and
justice is of little moment in his eyes——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span><span class='sc'>Julian.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I know it; I know all you tell me. Alexander
is a rough man, without morals and without
eloquence. Alexander has in no way deserved so
great advancement. But you may tell the citizens
of Antioch that they have deserved Alexander.
Ay, they have, if possible, deserved a still worse
ruler, covetous and intractable as they are——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Libanius.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It is, then, as we feared; this is a punishment——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Julian.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Hear me, Libanius! How did I come hither?
With full confidence in the people of this city.
Antioch, chosen by the Sun-King for his especial
seat, was to help me to repair all the wrong and
ingratitude which had so long been shown to the
immortals. But how have you met me? Some
with defiance, others with lukewarmness. What
have I not to endure here? Does not that Cappadocian,
Gregory of Nazianzus, still wander about
the city, stirring up the ignorant Galileans by his
audacious speeches? Has not a poet arisen among
them—a certain Apollinaris—who, with his wild
songs, inflames their fanaticism to the point of
madness?</p>

<p class='c001'>And what do I not learn from other places? In
Caesarea, have they not carried out their threat,
and wrecked the temple of Fortuna! Oh shame
and infamy! Where were the goddess’s worshippers
the while? Did they prevent it? No,
they did not lift a finger, Libanius, though they
should have laid down life itself to preserve the
sanctuary.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>But wait, wait! The Galileans of Caesarea shall
atone with their blood, and the whole city shall
go up in flames as soon as I have time at my disposal.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Libanius.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>My lord and friend,—if you would permit
me——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Julian.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Permit me, first. Say yourself whether I ought
to tolerate such things? Say whether my zeal can
bear with such insults to the divinities who hover
over and shield me? But what can I do? Have
I not laboured through many a long night to disprove
these unhappy delusions,—writing, Libanius,
till my eyes were red, and my fingers black with ink?
And what good, think you, has it done? I have
reaped scorn instead of thanks, not only from the
fanatics themselves, but even from men who pretend
to share my opinions. And now, to crown
all these mortifications, I find you acting as spokesman
for the complaints of a handful of citizens
against Alexander, who at least does his best to
keep the Galileans in check.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Libanius.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, my august friend,—that is precisely our
ground of complaint.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Julian.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Do <em class='gesperrt'>you</em> tell me this?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Libanius.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>’Tis not with my own good will that I do the
city’s errands. I urged upon the council that they
ought to choose for this task the most distinguished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>man in the town, thereby implying that I did not
wish to be chosen. Despite this hint, the choice
fell on me, who am certainly not——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Julian.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, well, well! But oh, Libanius, that I must
hear from your mouth——!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Libanius.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I beg my crowned brother to remember that I
speak in the name of the city! For myself, I prize
the immortal gods as highly as any one. Where
would the art of oratory be without the legends
which the poets of bygone days have left to us?
May not these legends be likened to a rich vein
of ore, whence an accomplished orator can forge
himself both weapons and ornaments, if only he
understands how to work the metal skilfully?
How flat and insipid would not the maxims of
wisdom seem, expressed without images or comparisons
borrowed from the supernatural?</p>

<p class='c001'>But think, oh my friend—can you expect the
multitude to take this view, especially in such an
age as ours? I assure you that in Antioch, at any
rate, ’tis not to be hoped for. The citizens—both
Galileans and the more enlightened—have of late
years lived at peace without greatly concerning
themselves as to these matters. There is scarce a
household in the city wherein people are of one
mind upon things divine. But, until lately, domestic
peace has nevertheless prevailed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Now the case is altered. People have begun to
weigh creed against creed. Discord has broken out
between the nearest kinsmen. For example, a
citizen, whose name I forbear to mention, has
lately disinherited his son because the young man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>separated himself from the Galilean community.
Commerce and social life suffer from all this,
especially now, when scarcity reigns and famine
stands at the door.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Julian.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Enough, enough,—more than enough, Libanius!
You complain of scarcity. But tell me, has luxury
ever been more rampant than now? Is the
amphitheatre ever empty when it is reported that
a new lion has arrived from Africa? Last week,
when there was a talk of turning all idlers and
vagabonds out of the city because of the dearth,
did not the citizens loudly demand that the
gladiators and dancing-girls should be exempted;
for they felt they could not exist without them!</p>

<p class='c001'>Ah, well may the gods desert you in wrath over,
your folly! There are plenty of teachers of wisdom
in this city, but where is wisdom? Why do
so few tread in my footsteps? Why stop at
Socrates? Why not go a few steps further, and
follow Diogenes, or—if I dare say so—me, since
we lead you to happiness? For is not happiness
the goal of all philosophy? And what is happiness
but harmony with oneself? Does the eagle
want golden feathers? Or the lion claws of silver?
Or does the pomegranate-tree long to bear fruits
of sparkling stone? I tell you no man has a right
to enjoy until he has steeled himself to forbear.
Ay, he ought not to touch enjoyment with
his finger-tips until he has learnt to trample it
under foot.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ah truly, we are far from that! But for that
end will I work with all my might. For the sake of
these things I will give up others which are also
important.  The Persian king—alarmed at my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>approach—has offered me terms of peace. I think
of accepting them, that I may have my hands free
to enlighten and improve you, intractable generation!
As to the other matter, it must remain as
it is. You shall keep Alexander. Make the best
you can of him.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet, my Libanius, it shall not be said that I
have sent you from me in disfavour——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Libanius.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Ah, my Emperor——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Julian.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You mentioned with a certain bitterness that I
had given much to Themistius and Mamertinus.
But did I not also take something from them?
Did I not take from them my daily companionship?
’Tis my intent to give you more than I gave them.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Libanius.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Ah, what do you tell me, my august brother?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Julian.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>’Tis not my intent to give you gold or silver.
That folly prevailed with me only at first, until I
saw how people flocked round me, like thirsty
harvesters round a fountain, elbowing and jostling
one another, and each stretching out a hollow
hand to have it filled first, and filled to the brim.
I have grown wiser since. I think it may be said
in particular that the Goddess of Wisdom has not
withdrawn her countenance from me in the
measures I have taken for the good of this city.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Libanius.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Doubtless, doubtless!</p>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span><span class='sc'>Julian.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Therefore I commission you, oh my Libanius, to
compose a panegyric on me.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Libanius.</span></div>
  </div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Julian.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You must lay special stress on the benefits for
which the citizens of Antioch owe me gratitude.
I hope you will produce an oration that shall do
honour both to the orator and to his subject. This
task, my Libanius, shall be my gift to you. I know
of nothing more fitting to offer to a man like you.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And now to the fencing-hall. Then, my friends,

in dress and simplicity in manners.</p>

<p class='c001'>Oh, Gregory, how can you ask us to remain
steadfast amid these horrors?—Brethren and
sisters—know you what has happened in Arethusa?
The unbelievers have maltreated the old bishop
Marcus, dragged him by the hair through the
streets, cast him into the sewers, dragged him up
again, bleeding and befouled, smeared him over
with honey and set him in a tree, a prey to wasps
and poisonous flies.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregory.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And has not God’s power been gloriously manifested
in this very Marcus? What was Marcus
before? A man of doubtful faith. When the
troubles broke out in Arethusa, he even fled from
the city. But behold—-no sooner had he heard in
his hiding-place that the raging crew were avenging
the bishop’s flight on innocent brethren, than
he returned of his own free will. And how did
he bear the torments which so appalled even his
executioners, that in order to withdraw with some
show of credit, they offered to release him if he
would pay a very trifling fine? Was not his
answer: No—and no, and again no? The Lord
God was with him. He neither died nor yielded.
His countenance showed neither terror nor impatience.
In the tree wherein he hung, he thanked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>God for being lifted a few steps nearer heaven,
while the others, as he said, crawled about on the
flat earth.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>A miracle must have happened to the resolute
old man. If you had heard, as I did, the shrieks
from the prison, that day in the summer when
Hilarion and the others were tortured——! They
were like no other shrieks—agonised, rasping,
mixed with hissing sounds every time the white-hot
iron buried itself in the raw flesh.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Apollinaris.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, Cyrillus, have you forgotten how the shrieks
passed over into song? Did not Hilarion sing
even in death? Did not that heroic Cappadocian
boy sing until he gave up the ghost under the
hands of the torturers? Did not Agathon, that
boy’s brother, sing until he swooned away, and
then woke up in madness?</p>

<p class='c001'>Verily I say unto you, so long as song rings out
above our sorrows, Satan shall never conquer!</p>

one for another, as Serapion in Doristora lately
suffered for his brothers, for love of whom he let
himself be scourged, and cast alive into the
furnace!</p>

<div class='c019'>[<i>He kicks the head of Apollo.</i></div>

<p class='c001'>Have you ever been mightier, in yourself?</p>

<p class='c001'>Strange, Maximus, that there should dwell such

it possible to build up again the fallen world of
beauty.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Friend—if delusion be a necessity to you, return

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You know well that that is impossible. Emperor
and Galilean! How reconcile that contradiction?</p>

<p class='c001'>Yes, this Jesus Christ is the greatest rebel that
ever lived. What was Brutus—what was Cassius,
compared with <em class='gesperrt'>him</em>? They murdered only the
man Julius Caesar; but he murders all that is
called Caesar or Augustus. Is peace conceivable
between the Galilean and the Emperor? Is there
room for the two of them together upon the earth?
For he lives on the earth, Maximus,—the Galilean
lives, I say, however thoroughly both Jews and
Romans imagined that they had killed him; he
lives in the rebellious minds of men; he lives in
their scorn and defiance of all visible authority.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>“Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s,—and
to God the things that are God’s!” Never
has mouth of man uttered a craftier saying than
that. What lies behind it? What, and how
much, belongs to the Emperor? That saying is
nothing but a bludgeon wherewith to strike the
crown from off the Emperor’s head.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Maximus.</span></div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Julian.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, could one only be as easily satisfied as they!
But call you that ruling the empire of the world?
Constantine widened the boundaries of his
dominion, but did he not fix narrow boundaries to
his spirit and his will? You rate that man too
high when you call him “the great.” Of my
predecessor I will not speak; he was more slave
than Emperor, and I cannot be contented with
the name alone.</p>

<p class='c001'>No, no, a truce is not to be thought of in this
contest. And yet—to have to give way! Oh,
Maximus, after these defeats I cannot retain the
crown—yet neither can I renounce it.</p>

<p class='c001'>You, Maximus, who can interpret omens whose

<p class='c001'>So is it. We must look closely into such supernatural
signs; for there is wont to be a double
meaning in them. It even seems at times as if
mysterious powers took a delight in leading men
astray, especially in great undertakings. Were
there not some who held it an evil omen that the
colonnade in Hierapolis fell in and buried half a
hundred soldiers, just as we marched through the
city? But I say that that is a presage of a twofold
good. In the first place it foreshows the
downfall of Persia, and in the second place the
doom of the unhappy Galileans. For what soldiers
were they who were killed? Why, Galilean
convict-soldiers, who went most unwillingly to the
war; and therefore fate decreed them that sudden
and inglorious end.</p>

so shall the lion of the nations fall before our

this omen to our advantage? Need I
remind such learned men that when the Emperor

a lion, and a huge wild boar besides, were, in like
manner, slain in front of the Roman ranks?</p>
<div class='c019'>[<i>To Ammian.</i></div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The other is more doubtful, sire! Your
charger, Babylonius, was led forth, as you commanded,
fully equipped, to await your descent on
the other side of the mountain. But just at that
time a detachment of Galilean convict-soldiers
happened to pass. Heavily laden as they were,
and by no means over willing, they had to be
driven with scourges. Nevertheless they lifted
up their arms as in rejoicing, and burst forth into
a loud hymn in praise of their deity. Babylonius
was startled by the sudden noise, reared in his
fright, and fell backwards; and as he sprawled
upon the ground, all his golden trappings were
soiled and bespattered with mud.</p>

<p class='c001'>Babylonius fell. The lion succumbed before
my soldiers. Yet these things do not tell us what
invisible help we have to depend upon. The gods,
whose essence is as yet by no means duly ascertained,
seem sometimes—if I may say so—to
slumber, or, on the whole, to concern themselves
very little with human affairs. We, my dear
friends, are so unfortunate as to live in such an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>age. We have even seen how certain divinities
have neglected to support well-meant endeavours,
tending to their own honour and glory.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet must we not judge rashly in this matter.
It is conceivable that the immortals, who guide
and uphold the universe, may sometimes depute
their power to mortal hands,—not thereby,
assuredly, lessening their own glory; for is it not
thanks to them that so highly-favoured<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c012'><sup>[11]</sup></a> a mortal—if
he exist—has been born into this world?</p>

the fact that the Galileans believe the Jew, Jesus
of Nazareth, to have been thus elected; for these
men err—as I shall conclusively establish in my
treatise against them. But I will remind you of
Prometheus in ancient days. Did not that pre-eminent
hero procure for mankind still greater
blessings than the gods seemed to vouchsafe—wherefore
he had to suffer much, both pain and
despiteful usage, till he was at last exalted to the
communion of the gods—to which, in truth, he
had all the while belonged?</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>Julian.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Presently, Nevita! First I must tell you of a
strange dream I had last night.</p>

<p class='c001'>I dreamed that I saw a child pursued by a rich
man who owned countless flocks, but despised
the worship of the gods.</p>

<p class='c001'>This wicked man exterminated all the child’s
kindred. But Zeus took pity on the child itself,
and held his hand over it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then I saw this child grow up into a youth, under
the care of Minerva and Apollo.</p>

<p class='c001'>Further, I dreamed that the youth fell asleep
upon a stone beneath the open sky.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then Hermes descended to him, in the likeness
of a young man, and said: “Come; I will show
thee the way to the abode of the highest god!”
So he led the youth to the foot of a very steep
mountain. There he left him.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then the youth burst out into tears and lamentations,
and called with a loud voice upon Zeus.
Lo, then, Minerva and the Sun-King who rules
the earth descended to his side, bore him aloft to
the peak of the mountain, and showed him the
whole inheritance of his race.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>But this inheritance was the orb of the earth
from ocean to ocean, and beyond the ocean.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then they told the youth that all this should
belong to him. And therewith they gave him
three warnings: he should not sleep, as his race
had done; he should not hearken to the counsel
of hypocrites; and, lastly, he should honour as
gods those who resemble the gods. “Forget not,”
they said, on leaving him, “that thou hast an
immortal soul, and that this thy soul is of divine
origin. And if thou follow our counsel thou shalt
see our father and become a god, even as we.”</p>

with!</p>

march, and march, and march, and see not that
the heaven is straitened above them,—and know
not there are heights where it is wider.—Seems
it not, Maximus, as though men lived but to die?
The spirit of the Galilean is in this. If it be true,
as they say, that his father made the world, then
the son contemns his father’s work. And it is
just for this presumptuous frenzy that he is so
highly revered!</p>

<p class='c001'>How great was Socrates compared with him!
Did not Socrates love pleasure, and happiness, and

<p class='c001'>Oh, this treasure of lost wisdom I would fain

went forth to meet them, young and joyous, a

<p class='c001'>Why? I will tell you why.</p>

<p class='c001'>Hard by a certain town where once I lived,
there was a vineyard, renowned far and wide for
its grapes; and when the citizens wished to have
the finest fruits on their tables, they sent their
servants out to bring clusters from this vineyard.</p>

<p class='c001'>Many years after I came again to that city; but
no one now knew aught of the grapes that were
once so renowned. Then I sought the owner of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>the vineyard and said to him, “Tell me, friend,
are your vines dead, since no one now knows aught
of your grapes?” “No,” he answered, “but let
me tell you, young vines yield good grapes but
poor wine; old vines, on the contrary, bad grapes
but good wine. Therefore, stranger,” he added,
“I still gladden the hearts of my fellow citizens
with the abundance of my vineyard, only in another
form—as wine, not as grapes.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Do not reproach the age. Had the age been

which he alone should possess? Oh how is
not power divided? Has not Libanius the power
of eloquence in such fulness that men call him the
king of orators? Have not you, my Maximus, the
power of mystic wisdom? Has not that madman
Apollinaris of Antioch the power of ecstatic song
in a measure I needs must envy him? And then
Gregory the Cappadocian! Has he not the power
of indomitable will in such excess, that many have
applied to him the epithet, unbecoming for a
subject, of “the Great”? And—what is stranger
still—the same epithet has been applied to
Gregory’s friend, Basil, the soft-natured man with
girlish eyes. And yet he plays no active part in
the world; he lives here, this Basil—here in this
remote region, wearing the habit of an anchorite,
and holding converse with none but his disciples,
his sister Makrina, and other women, who are called
pious and holy. What influence do they not exert,
both he and his sister, through the epistles they
send forth from time to time. Everything, even
renunciation and seclusion, becomes a power to
oppose my power. But the crucified Jew is still

that it befits an Emperor, not only in the hour of
death, but throughout his whole life, to set an

<p class='c001'>Think not, sire, that I am blind to the danger
that lurks in renunciation. I know that my friend
Gregory says well when he writes that he holds
himself a hermit in heart, though not in the body.
And I know that this coarse clothing is of small
profit to my soul if I take merit to myself for
wearing it.</p>

<p class='c001'>But that is not my case. This secluded life
fills me with unspeakable happiness; that is all.
The wild convulsions through which, in these days,
the world is passing, do not here force themselves,
in all their hideousness, upon my eyes. Here I
feel my body uplifted in prayer, and my soul
purified by a frugal life.</p>

<p class='c001'>Oh my modest Basil, I fear you are ambitious
of more than this. If what I hear be true, your
sister has gathered round her a band of young
women whom she is training up in her own likeness.
And you yourself, like your Galilean
master, have chosen twelve disciples. What is
your purpose with them?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Truly! Equipped with all the weapons of
eloquence, you send your army against me. And
whence did you obtain this eloquence, this glorious
Greek art? From our schools of learning. What
right have you to it? You have stolen like a
spy into our camp, to find out where you can
most safely strike at us. And this knowledge you
are now applying to our greatest hurt!</p>

<p class='c001'>Let me tell you, Basil, that I have no mind to
suffer this scandal any longer. I will strike this
weapon out of your hands. Keep to your Matthew
and Luke, and other such unpolished babblers.
But henceforth you shall not be permitted to
interpret our ancient poets and philosophers; for
I hold it unreasonable to let you suck knowledge
and skill from sources in the truth of which you
do not believe. In like manner shall all Galilean
scholars be forbidden our lecture-halls; for what
is their business there? To steal our weapons
and use them against us.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Basil.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Sire, I have already heard of this strange determination.
And I agree with Gregory in maintaining
that you have no exclusive right either to
Grecian learning or to Grecian eloquence. I
agree with him when he points out that you use
the alphabet which was invented by the Egyptians,
and that you clothe yourself in purple, although it
first came into use among the people of Tyre.</p>

<p class='c001'>Ay, sire—and more than that. You subdue
nations, and make yourself ruler over peoples,
whose tongues are unknown and whose manners
are strange to you. And you have a right to do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>so. But by the same right whereby you rule the
visible world, he whom you call the Galilean rules
the invisible——</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Julian.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Enough of that! I will no longer listen to
such talk. You speak as though there were two
rulers of the world, and on that plea you cry halt
to me at every turn. Oh fools! You set up a
dead man against a living one. But you shall
soon be convinced of your error. Do not suppose
that amid the cares of war I have laid aside the
treatise I have long been preparing against you.
Perhaps you think I spend my nights in sleep?
You are mistaken! For “The Beard-Hater” I
reaped nothing but scorn,—and that from the
very people who had most reason to lay certain
truths to heart. But that shall in nowise deter
me. Should a man with a cudgel in his hand
shrink from a pack of yelping dogs?—Why did
you smile, woman? At what did you laugh?</p>

<p class='c001'>I know your tortuous tricks of speech. You
Galileans say one thing and mean another. And
that you call rhetoric! Oh mediocre minds!
What folly! <i>I</i> feel that the crucified Jew is
alive! Oh what a degenerate age, to find satisfaction
in such sophistries! But such is the
latter-day world. Madness passes for wisdom.
How many sleepless nights have I not spent in
searching out the true foundation of things?
But where are my followers? Many praise my
eloquence, but few, or none, are convinced by it.</p>

<p class='c001'>But truly the end is not yet. A great astonishment
will come upon you. You shall see how all
the scattered forces are converging into one.
You shall see how, from all that you now despise,
glory shall issue forth—and out of the cross on
which you hang your hopes I will fashion a ladder
for One whom you know not of.</p>

<p class='c001'>And I tell you, Emperor Julian, that you are
nought but a scourge in the hand of God—a
scourge foredoomed to chasten us by reason of our
sins. Woe to us that it must be so! Woe to us for
the discords and the lovelessness that have caused
us to swerve from the true path!</p>

<p class='c001'>Portents warned you, and you heeded them
not. Voices called you, and you heard them not.

<p class='c001'>I tell you, Oribases, and all of you,—if, indeed,
there be present any one else who would set limits
to the Emperor’s power,—that this would be the
very essence of impiety, and that I should therefore
be forced to take strong measures against it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Has not Plato long ago enunciated the truth
that only a god can rule over men? What meant
he by that saying? Answer me—what did he
mean? Far be it from me to assert that Plato—incomparable
sage though he was—had any individual,
even the greatest, in his prophetic eye.
But I think we have all seen what disorders result
from the parcelling out, as it were, of the supreme
power into several hands.</p>

<p class='c001'>Enough of that. I have already commanded that
the imperial busts shall be displayed about the

<p class='c001'>It must indeed. Can you imagine what Alexander
tells me? The frenzy of the Galileans has
passed all bounds since my departure. And it
increases day by day. They understand that my
victory in Persia will bring their extirpation in its
train; and with that shameless Gregory as their
leader, they now stand, like a hostile army in my
rear; in the Phrygian regions secret things are
preparing, no one knows to what end——</p>

<p class='c001'>What are they doing? Praying, preaching,
singing, prophesying the end of the world. And
would that that were all!—but they carry our
adherents away, and entice them into their rebellious
conspiracies. In Caesarea the congregation
has chosen the judge Eusebius to be their bishop,—Eusebius,
an unbaptised man—and he has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>so misguided as to accept their call, which, moreover,
the canon of their own church declares
invalid.</p>

<p class='c001'>But that is far from being the worst; worse,
worse, ten times worse is it, that Athanasius has
returned to Alexandria.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>A council of the church expelled him on account
of his unseemly zeal. The Galileans were tractable
under my predecessor.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yes, just think of it—this raging fanatic has
returned to Alexandria. His entrance was like a
king’s; the road was strewn with carpets and
green palm-branches. And what followed? What
do you think? The same night a riot broke out
among the Galileans. George, their lawful bishop,
that right-minded and well-disposed man, whom
they accused of lukewarmness in the faith, was
murdered—torn to pieces in the streets of the
city.</p>

<p class='c001'>But, sire, how were things suffered to go so far?

    <div><span class='sc'>Julian.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You may well ask where Artemius was. I will
tell you. Artemius has gone over to the Galileans.
Artemius himself has broken by force of arms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>into the Serapeion, that most glorious of earthly
temples,—has shattered the statues—has plundered
the altars, and destroyed that vast treasury
of books, which was of such inestimable value
precisely in this age of error and ignorance. I
could weep for them as for a friend bereft me by
death, were not my wrath too great for tears.</p>

idly on while such atrocities spread wider and
wider around!—Thirty days, you say! Why are
we loitering? Why are we pitching our tents?

what is at stake? We must hold a council of war.

There are none poverty-stricken and helpless among
them; they live together as brethren and sisters,—and
most of all now, when their obstinacy has
forced me to chastise them. These Galileans, you
must know, have something in their hearts which
I could greatly desire that you should emulate.

on both sides, so as to leave the face free.</p>

<p class='c001'>No. It seemed as though it wished to speak;
but it did not. It stood motionless, looking at
me. Its face was pale and distorted. Suddenly,
with both arms, it drew the drapery together over
its head, hid its face, and went straight out through
the tent-wall.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And what does the conqueror win? Is it worth
while to conquer? What has the Macedonian
Alexander, what has Julius Caesar won? Greeks
and Romans talk of their renown with cold
admiration,—while the other, the Galilean, the
carpenter’s son, sits throned as the king of love in
the warm, believing hearts of men.</p>

<p class='c001'>Where is he now?—Has he been at work elsewhere
since that happened at Golgotha?</p>

<p class='c001'>I dreamed of him lately. I dreamed that I
had subdued the whole world. I ordained that
the memory of the Galilean should be rooted out
on earth; and it was rooted out.—Then the spirits
came and ministered to me, and bound wings on
my shoulders, and I soared aloft into infinite
space, till my feet rested on another world.</p>

<p class='c001'>It <em class='gesperrt'>was</em> another world than mine. Its curve was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>vaster, its light more golden, and many moons
circled around it.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then I looked down at my own earth—the
Emperor’s earth, which I had made Galileanless—and
I thought that all that I had done was very
good.</p>

<p class='c001'>But behold, my Maximus,—there came a procession
by me, on the strange earth where I
stood. There were soldiers, and judges, and
executioners at the head of it, and weeping women
followed. And lo!—in the midst of the slow-moving
array, was the Galilean, alive, and bearing
a cross on his back. Then I called to him, and
said, “Whither away, Galilean?” But he turned
his face toward me, smiled, nodded slowly, and
said: “To the place of the skull.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Where is he now? What if <em class='gesperrt'>that</em> at Golgotha,
near Jerusalem, was but a wayside matter, a thing
done, as it were, in passing, in a leisure hour?
What if he goes on and on, and suffers, and dies,
and conquers, again and again, from world to
world?</p>

<p class='c001'>Oh that I could lay waste the world! Maximus,—is
there no poison, no consuming fire, that
could lay creation desolate, as it was on that day
when the spirit moved alone over the face of the
waters?</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f11'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r11'>11</a>. The original edition here reads “benådet,” and this reading
is followed in the translation. In the collected edition
of Ibsen’s works (Copenhagen 1899) the word becomes
“beåndet,” which is probably a misprint, but may, on the
other hand, be a correction. In that case, for “highly-favoured”
we should have to read “specially inspired.”
Ibsen uses the word “beåndet” several times in “Hedda
Gabler.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f12'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r12'>12</a>. In the collected edition (1899) the word <span lang="no" xml:lang="no">“sejre”</span> (to conquer)
of earlier editions is replaced by <span lang="no" xml:lang="no">“rejse”</span> (journey). This is
almost certainly a misprint.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f13'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r13'>13</a>. Here occurs the one clear case I have observed of a
revision of the text. In earlier editions the phrase ran <span lang="no" xml:lang="no">“da skal
der tændes rögoffer,”</span> meaning literally “then shall burnt-offerings
(smoke-offerings) be lighted.” In the collected
edition (1899) <span lang="no" xml:lang="no">“sonoffer”</span> (offerings of atonement) is substituted
for <span lang="no" xml:lang="no">“rögoffer.”</span> This can scarcely be a printer’s error;
and as one deliberate alteration has been made, it would seem
that the alterations noted on pp. 382 and 417 (especially the
former) may also be due, not to the printer, but to the poet.</p>

<p class='c001'>There are quite a few instances of missing punctuation. The
conventional period following the character’s name is sometimes
missing and has been added for consistency’s sake without
further comment. Those missing from setting and stage direction
are also added without comment, since there is no obvious purpose to be
served by the omission. However, the restoration of punctuation
missing from dialogue is noted below, since the punctuation is
frequently expressive.</p>

<p class='c001'>Volume I of this series included errata for each succeeding volume,

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
